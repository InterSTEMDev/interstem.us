             <p class="mt-30" style="margin-top: -50px">InterSTEM Coding Bootcamp is an 8-week summer program that intends to provide an opportunity for intensive training in coding and portfolio-building for middle/high school students in different parts of the world. Students will collaborate in teams of 3 - 5 to work on portfolio-worthy coding projects that showcase their creativity and problem-solving skills. The weekly workshops will introduce participants to the essential steps needed to plan and execute their own programming project.
               <br><br>If you are passionate about coding and developing applications, InterSTEM Coding Bootcamp is for you! Anyone who is currently attending high school is eligible to apply, and we will also accept some middle school students as well, even though high school students are more prioritized. There are two positions in which you can apply for, team leader or member, and they require different experience levels. Admission will be based upon essays, grades, rigors of classes, and standardized test scores.
