        <p> If you are passionate about coding and developing applications, InterSTEM Coding Bootcamp is for you! Anyone who is currently attending high school is eligible to apply, and we will also accept some middle school students, though high school students will be prioritized. There are two positions you can apply for, team leader or member, which require different experience levels. Admission will be based upon essays, grades, rigors of classes, and standardized test scores. Team leaders must have some experience with developing applications using one or more programming languages. For prospective members, it is not required but highly recommended that they are also proficient in coding in general.
        </p>
        <p>InterSTEM Coding Bootcamp is an 8-week summer program that intends to provide an opportunity for intensive training in coding and portfolio-building for middle/high school students in different parts of the world. Students will collaborate in teams of 3 - 5 to work on portfolio-worthy coding projects that showcase their creativity and problem-solving skills. Weekly workshops throughout the program will introduce participants to the essential steps needed to plan and execute their own programming project.</p>
