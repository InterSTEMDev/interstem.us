      As our world navigates the rapid technological innovations of the twenty-first century, ethical decisions have been exponentially complicated by the global range and influence of modern creations. The definition of ethicality - right or wrong - has become harder to define, making it harder to decide whether a company’s actions fall under that definition of “ethical.” Companies are now scrambling to redefine their business strategies to allow them to create ethical products that also meet consumers’ ever-changing demands. This brings about the question: how can the world judge whether something is ethical or not?  The world should judge ethicality by requiring companies to determine if their actions and products are ethical; companies can determine whether they are ethical by analyzing ethical frameworks, realigning themselves to meet self-standards, and taking responsibility for their actions.
      <br><br>Companies in the twenty-first century face a dilemma:  the paired increases of consumer demand for complex technology and consumer access to complex technology have led to a growing distrust of the companies that provide technology. The primary purpose of companies is to serve their customers and satisfy their demands, consequently, complex products such as iPhones and 3D printers are becoming increasingly available to the public (Wessel). This increased accessibility of technology also increases demand for these products; according to a Pew Research Center survey, 87% of adults said that having the internet was important to them (Auxier). However, this exponential growth of customers means that ethical issues have become harder to define and manage. Consumers have become wary of public institutions, demonstrated by the 50% of American adults who said that they were not comfortable with sharing personal data with a public official (Auxier). Negative media portrayal of companies has augmented the public’s suspicion of large and successful companies, such as Facebook’s infamous data breach incident involving Cambridge Analytica and Goldman Sachs AI algorithm that allegedly discriminated against women (Blackman). Thus, a company’s success at promoting their technology goes hand in hand with an escalating vulnerability to public distrust (Wessel). Companies must therefore find a way to demonstrate their ethicality.
      <br><br>Clayton Christensen’s Theory of Interdependence and Modularity describes the recent increase in ethical issues related to affluent companies (Wessel). Christensen’s Theory states that all constituents of a new business are interdependent on each other; however, with each subsequent innovation, technology has become a defining characteristic of modern society (Wessel). Companies now have the ability to target specific parts, or “modules” of a complex product in their quest to turn a profit, leading to a division of development (Wessel). This division leads to faster innovation; however, this means that executive control and decision-making becomes split between multiple entities, resulting in a diffusion of responsibility when ethical issues arise (Blackman).
      <br><br>In addition, innovators are assembling their products faster than ever in response to user demand. This realignment can cut down on the time it takes for society to come to a consensus of how ethical a company is (Wessel). As a result, companies may “cut corners” to increase their success in the short-term without regard for the ethicality of their actions. As part of an attempt to minimize unethical inventions, the United States Patent and Trademark Office set out guidelines for obtaining a patent in 1975 (General Information Concerning Patents). These state that the process of obtaining a patent must be ethical - attorneys and agents that approve patents have to show that they are of good character (General Information Concerning Patents). However, since this framework only monitors the ethicality of the patenting process, and not the products themselves, it is still up to companies to prove to consumers that they (and their products) are ethical.
      <br><br>Companies can better manage their ethics by carrying out a series of actions, which include: analyzing existing ethical infrastructure built into the current system, setting out clear protocol, creating ethics teams, and properly educating their employees on the importance of ethics (Blackman). There is extensive ethical infrastructure built into the current healthcare system, regulating the handling and privacy of patients’ data. Companies can refer to this framework and realign themselves by creating protocol that address how ethical issues should be handled in the modern world (Blackman). To ensure that the created protocol is effective, companies should assign individuals from different positions, such as ethicists and business members, to their ethics management teams so that multiple viewpoints can be provided (Wessel). For example, 23andMe, a direct-to-consumer DNA test company, has designated third-party ethical advisers that provide a societal viewpoint of their data use to their management team (Wessel). If created correctly, these ethics teams will be able to guide companies in deciding if something is ethical or not (Blackman). It is also important to educate employees about the importance of making the correct ethical decisions; major accidents could occur if protocol is not followed. Therefore, for products to be ethically made and deployed, leaders must take responsibility and inspire their employees to work together.
      <br><br>If a company is taking the time to analyze ethical frameworks, realign themselves to their appropriate protocol, and take responsibility for their actions, then it should be simple for the world to decide if something is ethical or not. Companies that are meeting consumer demands while following clear ethical protocol should be considered ethical. On the other hand, unethical companies should be classified as companies whose decisions only benefit themselves; harming their users, and society, in the long run. By educating employees about the importance of taking responsibility for their actions, companies will earn the world’s trust, and the line between ethical and unethical should become crystal clear.
