		<h2 style="font-family: Ergonomique Bold">Handwriting vs. typing notes, and does font color matter?</h2>
<p>Nadwa Atwi. 04/23/2021</p>
<hr />

<p>Taking notes is one of the most important parts of the learning process. Students often spend a lot of time considering how to take notes, only to end up choosing a technique unfit for the material they’re tackling. So here we’ll be covering the pros and cons of each and discussing the right font-color combination for ideal note-taking.</p>

<p><br />
<b>Comparison</b></p>

<p>1. Accuracy</p>
<p>When it comes to accuracy, typing certainly wins out as it’s much faster to type than to write something down. However, this definitely depends on the material one is taking notes on. If it demands that notes be taken down verbatim then transcribing the lecturer’s speech, this would call for a laptop. But it’s very important to note that taking down notes in the form of a transcript isn’t effective for all subjects. A study was conducted by <a href="https://www.psychologicalscience.org/news/releases/take-notes-by-hand-for-better-long-term-comprehension.html" target="_blank">psychology scientists Pam Mueller and Daniel Oppenheimer</a> in which students were asked to write down notes on a number of TED talks using the method that they normally used to take notes. The results showed that although the two types of note-takers did equally well on questions that required facts-citation, laptop note-takers performed particularly worse on the conceptual questions. That made the scientists suggest that students who took down handwritten notes were involved in more information processing than laptop users. As a result, they sorted through the information and opted for the more relevant ones to add to their notes. Additionally, the study suggests that writing by hand improves memory retention and understanding.</p>

<p>The conclusion was that students who took more notes scored higher on the test, but that also applied to those who had less verbatim overlap. This proposes that unconscious transcription nullifies the advantage of having more content.</p>

<p>2. Legibility, organization and accessibility</p>
<p>Typing notes on a laptop offers a more aesthetic structure, easier editing and instant spelling check. So laptop users have the advantage of not having to worry about bad handwriting or making a mess of their notes when they make a mistake. While sharing handwritten notes could be a hassle, sharing digital notes is a piece of cake. Not to mention syncing them across devices makes them accessible anytime and anywhere.</p>

<p>3. Distractions</p>
<p>The ease and simplicity laptops offer come at a price. Although the extra tools and resources they provide save the note-taker the inconveniences that other note-takers face, that also means more distractions. For example, many people cannot resist checking social media while they’re in a lecture.</p>

<p>Studies also show that the laptop user is not the only one affected by those distractions. According to <a href="https://www.gse.harvard.edu/news/uk/17/08/note-taking-low-tech-often-best" target="_blank">Harvard University</a>, researchers at York and McMaster conducted an experiment in which they had students watch a lecture and then take a comprehension test. Some students were randomly asked to carry out a couple of short tasks on their laptops during the lecture, like looking up movie times. The rest of the students were allowed to focus on the lecture. All seats were randomly assigned.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, the multitasking students scored about 11% lower on the test than those who focused on the lecture. But interestingly, the students sitting near the multitaskers also got affected. Students who weren’t multitasking but could view the screen of a multitasker’s laptop scored 17% lower on comprehension than those who had no distracting view. So it’s important to note that by choosing typing as a method of note-taking, one could potentially distract those around them.</p>

<p><br /><br />
<b>Factors to consider when deciding which method to use when taking notes:</b></p>

<p>1. The type of learning that is called for</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://effectiviology.com/handwriting-vs-typing-how-to-take-notes/" target="_blank">Effectiviology</a>, note-taking through typing works better when the material requires factual learning, which involves memorizing specific details and merely entails a shallow understanding of the material. However, conceptual learning, which involves securing a rigorous understanding of the fundamental concepts in the material, calls for taking notes manually by hand.
On that account, the student must first determine the kind of material they’re dealing with and choose the note-taking method accordingly.</p>

<p>2. The length and type of notes</p>
<p>Another aspect a student should take into consideration is the length of the text they’ll eventually end up with. Writing notes down by hand proves to be a physically exhausting method when there’s a lot to write down, and of course, there’s a certain limit to how fast a person can write. Consequently, this method demands the note-taker to be more concise, which can be convenient since it means that only the more relevant aspects of the material are included in the notes. But the student could also end up leaving out significant details in the process.</p>

<p>On the other hand, typing notes allows the student to write more details, as typing is a faster process than writing. This definitely comes in handy when there are lots of points to cover. However, it’s crucial to note that there’s the disadvantage of writing too much that the unnecessary details end up overriding the important ones. That makes it more difficult to study the notes at a later time.</p>

<p>Again, this depends on the type of learning that we previously discussed.
Another point worth mentioning is the type of notes the student is taking. For example, mathematical formulas are definitely faster to write down than to type. The same thing applies to sketching and labeling figures, as handwritten notes allow more freedom with the graphics and thus are more flexible in that aspect.</p>

<p><br /><br />
<b>Font color</b></p>

<p>Something that applies to both handwritten and typed notes is the font color. Color is a form of visible light, essentially a portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Each color has its own wavelength that can affect neurological pathways in the brain, creating a biochemical response. Consequently, using the right color, along with the right selection and arrangement, can have a significant impact on feelings, concentration and behavior when learning. According to <a href="https://www.shiftelearning.com/blog/how-do-colors-influence-learning" target="_blank">Shift Learning</a>, although it isn’t definite science, each color can elicit its own unique biological response.</p>

<p>Green promotes tranquility and calm and improves concentration, as it’s a low-frequency color. In a study led by <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/technology/seeing-green-boosts-your-concentration-research-shows-20150525-gh8udh.html" target="_blank">Dr. Kate Lee</a>, 150 university students were given a tedious task, which involved pressing a key as a series of numbers repeatedly flashed on a computer screen. They were asked not to press the key when the number three popped up on the screen. The students were given a short break halfway through the task to look at a city rooftop scene. Half of the students looked at a green roof whereas the other half viewed a bare concrete roof. After the break, students who looked at the greener scenery made considerably fewer errors and showed better concentration than those who viewed the concrete roof.</p>

<p>Orange is a mood lifter and a stimulator, as <a href="https://www.scienceofpeople.com/color-psychology/#:~:text=Orange%20is%20a%20color%20of,effect,%20and%20stimulates%20brain%20activity." target="_blank">it has been found</a> to increase oxygen supply to the brain, producing an energizing effect. It is best used for highlighting and accentuating certain parts in notes.</p>

<p>Blue promotes productivity. Some research suggests that people with particularly intellectual work like programmers and academics are more productive in the presence of blue surroundings. Blue is best used for learning situations that are challenging and ones that require substantial comprehension.</p>

<p><br />
<b>The verdict</b></p>

<p>When it comes to the learning method, it all comes down to preference! And the type of material one is dealing with. Both techniques have their pros and cons, but if the material equally allows for either method to be used, then writing by hand is surely the way to go because it allows learners to comprehend and retain information better than typing does.</p>

<p>What’s also worth mentioning is the fact that recently, tablets have become the go-to device for students, as it bears some of the best aspects of both methods: handwritten notes that can be easily organized and shared.</p>

<p>Regarding the font color, notes shouldn’t be kept too monochrome, so it is best to use blue along with one or two other colors. In any case, trial and error is key so remember to stay open-minded and try out different techniques with different materials.</p>
