<p>Mehri Sadri. 01/22/2021</p>
<hr />

<p><br />
Normality. A concept that has been seemingly destroyed by a global pandemic for almost 10 months. With 21st-century science innovation and unlimited funding, many expected a quick solution to the problems that have pierced the lives of millions. However, science cannot be rushed, as safety and surrounding logistics still linger during the initial inoculation process of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. Many individuals wonder when they’ll get the vaccine, and this evidently depends on one’s surrounding resources, location, vocation and risk for contracting the virus. Below is a detailed, yet estimated timeline for when vaccines will be distributed throughout 2021, and when individuals can be expected to return back to emerging feelings of “normalcy”: slowly, but surely.</p>

<p>Though COVID-19 vaccines are not accessible to everyone as of January 2021, mid-December marked the healthcare worker rollout. This makes sense, as healthcare workers have been risking their lives every day to care for firsthand COVID-19 patients. However, there is another group of early vaccinators that have been receiving backlash for their place within this timeline. Older Americans who reside in nursing homes have been another high-risk category that has received vaccine doses in large quantities. According to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/05/health/covid-vaccine-first.html" target="_blank">The New York Times</a>, choosing which group to prioritize has been a large issue, as it is often a debate of ‘human preservation’ versus ‘the slowing rate of spread.’ Though healthcare workers are an integral part of the essential work-force, there are also thousands of other Americans providing services in grocery stores and restaurants, sectors that are considered essential to keep American families in check. So far, there has been an increasing amount of support for placing essential workers before senior citizens and instead putting elder citizens at a subphase, known as phase 1b of the vaccination treatment.</p>

<p>With numerous first-responders being vaccinated with either one or both doses today, there is a new phase, which started in late December and ends mid-January, that encompasses a larger population of individuals. Of course, essential healthcare workers who were not a part of this initial phase are included, but high-risk persons, K-12 teachers and nurses who work in long-term facilities have also been added into the mix. The teachers receiving the COVID-19 vaccine primarily contain those who are a part of districts that resumed in-person learning. Though most schools are in locations classified as red tiered, meaning a greater risk of infection, some schools have stayed open as early as October, thus qualifying teachers to <a href="https://edsource.org/2021/some-california-teachers-and-staff-to-receive-covid-19-vaccines-beginning-this-week/646526" target="_blank">receive vaccinations during this beginning phase</a>.</p>

<p>Though most shipped vaccines will be put to use, there will always be a few outliers: vaccines that aren’t put to use. With these extras, California governor Gavin Newson plans to remain flexible, administering the extra doses to other essential works, such as food and agricultural workers, teachers or additional healthcare workers. No vaccine dosage will go to waste! Though a possibility, there will likely be few extra vaccines, considering that there are pandemic centers in California like Los Angeles that are in dire need of protection for their many healthcare workers forced to work longer shifts.</p>

<p>After all healthcare and essential workers have received the vaccine, it would be time to distribute it to senior citizens, those over the age of 65. This would be known as phase 1c, likely encompassing one of the larger groups of qualified patients. Although this phase does encompass all senior citizens, the highest priority would go to those who are immunocompromised, meaning that going out every day and returning to normal life would be an even greater risk than before. Although there is no set time for this phase’s subsection, <a href="https://whyy.org/articles/when-will-it-be-your-turn-to-get-the-coronavirus-vaccine-heres-a-guide/#" target="_blank">experts expect this wave to occur</a> around March or April of 2021. However, with current inoculation backlogs, this could, unfortunately, be pushed back a bit further.</p>

<p>Once these groups have all received the COVID-19 vaccine, it would be time to transition into stage 2: everyone else. Individuals who are not included in the priority groups mentioned in stage 1 would be included here, and this comprises most of the U.S. population. Though vaccinations do provide immense protection from suffering disastrous COVID-19 effects, masks and other protective measures will still be mandated in public places, assuring that individuals are treated as safely as possible. 2021’s holiday season will likely entail the beginnings of society’s return to normalcy, as experts predict that most families can finally come together in joy and relief.</p>
