<center><i>5G has a lot of positive outlooks, but it is also important to consider the potential risks that it poses for our future technologies.

<p><br />
With COVID-19 cases on the rise and the continuation of quarantine becoming more and more evident, it doesn’t seem like going out and seeing people will become normal anytime soon, so maybe the announcement that an even faster generation of cellular networks is coming out was exciting. However, while many people may see the progression of 5G technology as a good thing, after closer analysis, do the disadvantages outweigh the advantages? Here’s everything you should know about the new 5G technology.</p>

<p>Throughout the past few decades, we have seen many developments in various forms of technology, one of the biggest being what we use to communicate with others every day: cellphones. First came 1G, where we were given the first-ever analog cell phones. Next was 2G where instant messaging and voicemails were debuted. Then, we had 3G where web browsing was improved; we could share images with one another, and we could track our locations. After, we had 4G where the overall smartphone was improved. Each of these advancements was crucial in shaping the technology we have today, so obviously, the release of the most recent and biggest form of cellular networks is a big deal.</p>

<p>Let’s start off with what 5G is. 5G is the 5th generation of mobile technologies and networks. It is said to have high speeds, becoming much more efficient and effective than 4G. 5G offers a wide range of uses, not just for cell phone users, but for numerous companies in a variety of fields such as medicine, agriculture and artificial intelligence. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/03/business/what-is-5g/index.html" target="_blank">CNN</a> says it is “expected to change the way people live and work”. It is predicted to give us a great number of advancements that will help shape and change our future. <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/5g/what-is-5g" target="_blank">Qualcomm</a> reports that 5G will have $13.2 trillion of global economic output, create 22.3 million new jobs and grow the GDP by $2.1 trillion.</p>

<p>5G has many foreseeable positive outcomes and is expected to help many different fields in advancing their use of technology. In the medical field, 5G’s low latency will help robotic surgeries to become more precise and bring about quicker response times. In addition, hospitals will now be able to exchange high-quality images with one another, allowing doctors to work more collaboratively. Overall, the healthcare field will be able to provide better services through many improvements like advancements in health monitoring.</p>

<p>5G also has an outlook on improvements in other fields like agriculture and artificial intelligence. We will be able to see improvements in all sorts of machines ranging from tractors to self-driving cars. 5G has expanded the range of what cellular networks can be used for, and now that we have a better ecosystem of different technologies being brought together, all the different fields can be enhanced.</p>

<p>On paper, 5G looks like the best thing that came out of 2020, but there are a number of disadvantages that need to be considered when thinking about how 5G could shape our future. In contrast to the fact that it will provide extremely fast speeds, it will have a questionable range. While the connections are very powerful, they aren’t able to carry across long distances. One cause for this problem is that 5G can often be blocked by large physical objects such as trees and buildings. This disadvantage has caused companies implementing 5G to focus on big cities with dense populations, often leaving out rural areas.</p>

<p>Another major disadvantage is the cost of 5G. Building the towers and structures needed to support 5G does not come cheap, and companies will be investing a high fortune to make this possible. Monetary burdens are not just for the companies providing the services but also for the people looking to use them. 5G is a very powerful network, but to match it, users would need technology capable of handling its networks and connections. With the phones that are currently accessible to the public, a 5G connection would overheat them and drain their battery life. This would mean users would have to replace their old technology, such as phones and computers, with ones that can effectively manage 5G. This offers a great inconvenience to the public because of how expensive, as well as fast-changing, technology can be in today’s world.</p>

<p>Another risk is security. While 5G is helping to improve things like medical research and military communication services, it is highly important that it is secured. Important networks like 5G can’t be susceptible to data breaches or theft, which is an issue that providers are still battling. Users, whether that be companies or individuals, need to be able to rely on their network, feeling safe that their private information is secured.</p>

<p>These are the advantages and disadvantages of 5G, but it still leaves open the question of whether or not it’s worth giving a shot. Companies like Apple have definitely capitalized off the idea, making it one of their highest selling points for their most recent phone release, the iPhone 12. Further, cellular providers like Verizon have definitely been marketing their usage of 5G as well. As 5G continues to spread, only time will tell whether or not it will come out successful and how it will shape the future of technology.</p>
