&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;An exhausted woman struggles to fall asleep despite the late hour. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.utoimage.com/?m=goods.photo_view&amp;amp;pm=goods.search&amp;amp;catg=CILL&amp;amp;sf=local&amp;amp;mk=%EB%B6%88%EB%A9%B4%EC%A6%9D&amp;amp;page=1&amp;amp;idx=20924827&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;(Utoimage)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Over a year ago, the world found itself facing a pandemic that forced several countries into lockdown and chaos. Many might believe that staying at home would have helped people to finally solve the all-too-familiar problem of sleep deprivation. So has it helped the world to catch up on lost sleep? Or did the pandemic make everything worse?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Revenge bedtime procrastination&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Back in 2014, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00611/full&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a study from the Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; revealed how procrastination can be found in sleeping and was not limited to the academic sector. Coining it bedtime procrastination (later renamed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20201123-the-psychology-behind-revenge-bedtime-procrastination&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;revenge bedtime procrastination&lt;/a&gt; in 2018), the collaborators of the study defined it as the tendency to push back on sleep for no reasonable explanation. Procrastination is an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/are-you-procrastinating-more-blame-the-pandemic&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;emotional coping strategy&lt;/a&gt; that is used when faced with high levels of stress. Thus, the heightened levels of stress brought by the pandemic have made it more difficult for people to resist the urge of staying up at night. Despite being aware of its consequences, the desire for a temporary escape from the never-ending demands during the daytime makes people fall into an unhealthy cycle that evidently takes a toll on &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.gallup.com/poll/327311/americans-mental-health-ratings-sink-new-low.aspx&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt;. Adults worldwide have expressed dissatisfaction with how long they sleep and more than half of the Americans surveyed by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://j2vjt3dnbra3ps7ll1clb4q2-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sleep-prioritization-survey-2021-covid-somnia.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM)&lt;/a&gt; have reported new sleep problems post-pandemic. But the problem is yet to be solved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Coronasomnia&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;On top of throwing the world into a &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34006330/#:~:text=Most%20patients%20with%20COVID%2D19,septic%20shock%2C%20and%20cardiovascular%20manifestations.&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;health crisis&lt;/a&gt;, insomnia became an even larger problem. It was already the &lt;a href=&quot;https://openstax.org/books/psychology-2e/pages/4-4-sleep-problems-and-disorders&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;most common sleeping disorder&lt;/a&gt; before the pandemic but has increased so much so that a new term called “Coronasomnia” is being used. Coronasomnia, a portmanteau (i.e., blend) of the words “coronavirus” and “insomnia”, has been used to describe the recently surging cases of insomnia as a result of the pandemic. In short, those with insomnia struggle to fall asleep and stay asleep even if they manage to. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-revenge-bedtime-procrastination-5189591&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Stress, anxiety, and depression&lt;/a&gt; are all common side effects of sleep deprivation, and in turn, can lead to both insomnia and revenge bedtime procrastination. But if staying at home means easy access to beds, why has this reduced levels of sleep as opposed to increasing them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Boundaries between work, school and home&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Forcing adults and students to stay home has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/revenge-bedtime-procrastination-a-plight-of-our-times#What-is-it,-and-why-does-it-happen?&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;“blurred the line”&lt;/a&gt; between academic or work life and personal life. Though it may seem unimportant at first glance, keeping a distinct separation between the two is an important factor toward reducing work or school-related stress and maintaining mental health. When they become so closely intertwined to the point that it is hard to tell where one starts and the other ends, it makes it increasingly difficult to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.charityjob.co.uk/careeradvice/keep-work-and-home-life-separate/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;“switch off”&lt;/a&gt; from one and focus on the other, which can thus influence productivity. It also leads to an increased risk of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.healthassured.org/blog/risk-burnout-everyone-needs-break-work/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;burning out&lt;/a&gt; if overworked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Escalated technology use&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Aside from meetings and classes being replaced with virtual alternatives, people have become increasingly reliant on technology to communicate with friends or take a break from the turmoil. Since many areas have been on lockdown for over a year and counting, the restrictions make it difficult for people to meet up in person. And although people have already been reliant on devices before the virus, people cannot help but use more of them now since there aren’t many options open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social media and streaming services are more accessible than ever before and everything is only a click away. So when exhausted and stressed individuals have had a long day, it is far more likely for them to whip out their phone or turn on their TV than take a jog outside. Students who used to meet their friends outside have now turned to social media or other chatting platforms to make up for the loss of social interaction. And having a smartphone readily available just before bed makes people even more susceptible to revenge bedtime procrastination and coronasomnia. According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://openstax.org/books/psychology-2e/pages/4-1-what-is-consciousness&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;OpenStax&lt;/a&gt;, melatonin, a hormone that helps to regulate sleep, is “stimulated by darkness and inhibited by light”. So staying up late at night staring at a bright computer screen will signal the brain to stop producing melatonin and is counterproductive toward a better night’s sleep. The pandemic seems to be far from drawing to a close, so how can people improve their sleeping habits?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Adjustments to improve sleep&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Due to the sudden changes in lifestyle, it is only natural that individuals’ circadian rhythms have been thrown out of balance. One way to slowly return to a normalized sleep schedule is to keep screens off in the bedroom. As mentioned above, stopping the production of melatonin will only keep the brain more alert. Instead, read a book or engage in an alternative activity that does not require a device. Avoid taking naps longer than 20 to 30 minutes to allow adenosine (a chemical that promotes sleep at night) to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-couch/202101/7-ways-get-sleep-stay-asleep-and-get-back-sleep&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;build up&lt;/a&gt; throughout the day. And although it may be tempting to do everything in bed, marking it as the “sleeping place” can help the &lt;a href=&quot;https://health.ucdavis.edu/health-news/newsroom/covid-19-is-wrecking-our-sleep-with-coronasomnia--tips-to-fight-back-/2020/09&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;brain associate it with only sleep&lt;/a&gt; and not productivity. In addition to maintaining a regular daily sleeping and working schedule, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.healthline.com/health-news/coronasomnia-how-the-pandemic-may-be-affecting-your-sleep#How-to-get-the-rest-you-need&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;setting aside&lt;/a&gt; an hour or two specifically for relaxation can help to prevent revenge bedtime procrastination and thus improve sleep cycles. And finally, keep in mind that an individual suspecting they may be suffering from insomnia or any other health issue should always consult or reach out to a medical professional instead of self-diagnosing. Even if it turns out to be nothing, it is always better to be safe instead of risking further consequences in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, there are unprecedented levels of greenhouse gasses in the air and global temperatures continue to rise. Still, humans heavily rely on the use of fossil fuels to create the electricity that most of the world runs on. Up until recently, fossil fuels have been more convenient and cost effective. However, with the many advances in science, renewable alternatives to fossil fuels have become much more realistic and useful. Here are some of the leading renewable energy alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Solar power is a common energy alternative. By utilizing photovoltaic cells made of silicon, it absorbs energy from sunlight. The energy knocks electrons away from atoms and flows through conductors to form an electrical circuit that creates direct current electricity. There is an abundance of solar energy in theory since there are enough photons hitting the earth within an hour to generate power for about a year. Despite being the fastest-growing source of energy, however, solar energy provides just 0.5% of the energy on earth. When placing solar panels, though, it is important to set them up in certain locations. Certain cities that are generally foggy such as San Francisco are not ideal for solar panels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For these locations, wind turbines might be a better option. Wind turbines work by using blades like a propeller, which are turned by the wind and therefore turn a generator that creates electricity. Usually, wind turbines use either a two or three bladed propeller. There are about 57,000 wind turbines in the United States and if placed in the ideal location, each of these turbines could power a single home. That is, assuming that they are all small turbines. Very large wind turbines with blades about 162 meters long can generate up to 58 times the energy of small wind turbines. Furthermore, wind turbines have to be placed in mountainous regions or regions with similar wind levels in order for them to generate a reasonable amount of power. Some of the largest barriers to increasing the amount of wind turbines is their large size and unappealing appearance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nuclear energy also generates electricity. Though not exactly a renewable energy source, nuclear energy has zero emissions, so it is a positive form of energy for the sake of mitigating climate change. Within a nuclear power plant, uranium is split up into smaller atoms by using a process known as fission. This creates a heat source which is used to heat water and create steam. The steam is then converted into energy by using a turbine generator. This explains why nuclear energy generation does not produce fossil fuel emissions: none are burned. Nuclear energy is not renewable though because uranium is not a resource that renews itself like wind or sunlight. Nuclear energy is currently powering about 20% of the United States’ electricity. However, people are skeptical of expanding nuclear power because if a reactor were to melt down, all living organisms around the reactor could suffer radiation poisoning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, geothermal energy also utilizes steam to create energy. The steam for geothermal energy, however, comes from the ground, where hot pools of water lie a few miles beneath earth’s surface. This steam is then used to turn a turbine and generate electricity. To do this, three types of geothermal power plants are used: dry steam, flash steam, and binary steam. Dry steam uses steam found underground, like those near geysers for power generation. Flash steam uses water from underground reservoirs that have a temperature above 360 degrees Fahrenheit. The water decreases in pressure as it goes up into wells and steam is created. Finally, binary steam generation works on water as low as 225 degrees Fahrenheit and uses water to boil a low boiling point fluid, which is vaporized and used to create energy. The United States primarily produces geothermal energy from dry steam plants located in Northern California geysers because the other geysers are located in Yellowstone National Park. Iceland is also a large consumer of geothermal energy and creates about 25% of its electricity from geothermal plants and around 85% of heating and cooling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Finally, tidal energy is another form of renewable energy that is still in early development. Energy can be produced by utilizing the flow of the ocean between high and low tides. The three ways that it  is harnessed are in tidal streams, barrages, and tidal lagoons. Tidal stream generation involves placing the turbine in shallow, fast moving water that is created by the tide. Barrages are similar to dams that are used for hydropower and can be placed across water sources like bays and harnesses. Finally, a tidal lagoon source would work like a barrage on a natural coastline and would operate during the filling and emptying of the lagoon. Tidal energy is more powerful than wind energy because water is denser than air, and contrary to solar and wind, tides are reliably predictable. However, similar to hydropower, tidal energy disrupts the ocean and its ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, there are many alternatives to fossil fuels that can be found in the above list as well as some not listed. Although all the above methods have their pros and cons, together they can create a strong energy source for our future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogs/2021/august/parthenogenesisOne.png&quot; width=&quot;70%&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin: 0 auto&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;https://bastiani.biology.utah.edu/courses/3230/db%20lecture/Lectures/a8Pattern.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;(Developmental Biology 3230)&lt;/a&gt; This image represents the steps of asexual reproduction (also called parthenogenesis) in planarian, hydra, and starfish species.
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Biologically speaking, all animals have the blessing of procreation, the ability to bring a completely new individual into this world as a product of sexual intercourse between two partners of the opposite gender. However, some creatures can bypass the requirement of mating to create new life. Their bodies allow them to replicate themselves in such a way that the offspring contains the same biological information as the parent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some cases, the naturally occurring genetic modification will even produce fertile offspring. Nevertheless, some of the more highly intriguing processes hide behind a curtain of mystery from the public eye or have sunk into oblivion with the rest of the information learned in years of schooling. To shine some light onto some more precise concepts of parthenogenesis (also called incomplete asexual reproduction as sex cells are still involved), we will describe the four steps of the procedure, as well as some examples of the utility and marvels of this miraculous birthing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parthenogenesis consists of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thoughtco.com/parthenogenesis-373474&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2 main distinct phases&lt;/a&gt;: apomixis and automixis. Apomixis is the process of mitotic production of egg cells. In apomictic parthenogenesis, the oocyte, or female sexual cell, creates a copy of itself by mitosis, forming a pair of diploid cells. These diploid cells have all of the chromosomes needed for embryonary development. The derived offspring are exact copies of the parent cell. Some organisms that breed in this manner are aphids and flowering plants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In automixis, egg cells are produced by meiosis. Usually, in egg cell development, the resulting daughter cells are split unevenly during meiosis. Asymmetrical cytokinesis eventually results in one large egg cell (oocyte) and several smaller cells called polar bodies. The polar bodies degrade without fertilization. The oocyte is haploid (has only a single set of unpaired chromosomes) and becomes diploid (has two pairs of completed chromosomes) after it is fertilized by male sperm. Because automictic parthenogenesis does not require male involvement, the oocyte becomes diploid by combining with one of the polar bodies or by duplicating its chromosomes. Since the following offspring is a product of meiosis, the occurring genetic recombination makes these individuals false clones of the parent cell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://education.seattlepi.com/benefits-parthenogenesis-4022.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Benefits of parthenogenesis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Animal populations where individuals are scarce or isolated amongst themselves, benefit from parthenogenesis, as it removes the requirement of having a partner (for more than one organism to be present) for reproduction to be possible. If males are not accessible for sexual reproduction, parthenogenesis still grants the female a chance at procreation. More importantly, the females do not have to spend energy searching for a mate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In most organisms, parthenogenesis produces only female offspring, which has a definite advantage over other forms of reproduction. Female offspring are able to contribute directly to the population of a species, being able to bear and produce the next generation. As a result, the rate of population growth is increased for organisms that use parthenogenesis than among related species that reproduce through a method that creates both male and female offspring. In other words, parthenogenesis offers a noticeable advantage when the objective of reproduction is to maximize the number of offspring with the shortest delays possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since organisms created via parthenogenesis have a genetic code that belongs to only one individual instead of two, they are genetically stable.It means that all the cells that make up an organism contain identical genetic information which does not vary throughout their entire life. If a specific organism is particularly well suited to its niche and environment, and if that environment has sturdy living conditions, parthenogenesis can stabilize the species in the aforementioned environment even more. Nonoptimal genes may not be introduced into the genetic makeup of the species, and individual organisms can continue to thrive in an environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://education.seattlepi.com/benefits-parthenogenesis-4022.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Parthenogenesis Disadvantages&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though parthenogenetic reproduction can be advantageous, it is not as frequently encountered in animals as sexual reproduction, indicating its very specific advantages. Parthenogenesis can be disadvantageous because it limits the genetic diversity that comes from the recombination of genetic material. Recombination strengthens a species in the long term and allows for the selection of important traits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly enough, parthenogenesis can also occur in humans. However, it cannot produce viable embryos, as unfertilized eggs lack necessary genetic information that is normally provided by sperm. Spontaneous androgenetic and parthenogenetic occurrences happen amongst humans, but instead of creating viable embryos, they form human-like benign tumors or primitive non-viable fetuses with imperfect body parts. Nonetheless, there was one reported &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg14819982-300-the-boy-whose-blood-has-no-father/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;case&lt;/a&gt; of partial-parthenogenesis; a young boy with all his cells (such as blood cells) left without his father’s DNA. He was perfectly healthy, excluding his asymmetrical facial features and learning difficulties. Tracing back to this boy’s biological origins, scientists can infer that an unfertilized egg began the process of self-division, but proceeded to have some of its cells fertilized by sperm in early development. In other words, the boy is a parthenogenetic chimera, because he has two cell lineages in his organism. There have been no scientifically confirmed reports of a clinically healthy nonchimeric human produced from a single, parthenogenetic-activated oocyte.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the analysis of specific scenarios and historical evolution, parthenogenesis can be perceived as an animal way of reproduction, but one that excludes most mammals, including humans. In regards to the latter, no viable human embryos have ever been produced, so the miracle of virgin birth remains, in fact, a scientifically refuted phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Right now, as you read this, a 1.6 million-square-kilometer expanse of trash is sailing in the Pacific Ocean, off the coast of Hawai’i. The word ‘patch’ is a misnomer; that immense stretch of filth sailing amongst the thunderous waves of the Pacific Ocean isn’t a ‘patch’ in any sense of the word. It’s a collection of 1.8 trillion pieces of plastic – 250 for every human being alive, weighing about 80,000 tonnes. That’s about as heavy as 250 jumbo jets and spread over an area three times the size of France. This garbage, orbiting around 32°N and 145°W, is the world’s largest collection of ocean debris. Let’s dive deeper and learn more about the GPGP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These metric tonnes of garbage weren’t in the ocean since time immemorial. We humans are solely responsible for this nasty turn of events. Plastic items thrown in the ocean catch the flow of water currents, sail across thousands of kilometers, and end up in the patch. The area in the center of a gyre tends to be very calm and stable. Additionally, the circular motion of the gyre draws debris into this center, where it gets trapped for what seems like an eternity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Distribution of the debris&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogs/2021/august/garbageTwo.png&quot; width=&quot;70%&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin: 0 auto&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;
A modelled mass concentration of the garbage in the patch. &lt;a href=&quot;https://theoceancleanup.com/great-pacific-garbage-patch/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;(The Ocean cleanup)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The garbage within the patch is densely distributed but does not form a solid mass. There is no island of trash. Instead, it ranges from light, floatable plastics at the periphery to debris so big it touches the ocean floor. The center of the patch has more than 100kg/m2 of debris while there’s only 10kg/m2 on the boundary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plastic, which makes the entirety of the debris, does not decompose. Over the years, larger pieces just break into smaller fragments called microplastics. This deterioration into microplastics is usually the result of sun exposure, waves, marine life, and temperature changes. Microplastics have been discovered floating within the water surface layers, in the water column, and as far down as the ocean floor. These microplastics account for 94% of the floating pieces and simply do not go away. They are a hazard to aquatic animals, both small and large. They’re also very difficult to pull out of the ocean, being almost invisible from vessels due to their minuscule size ranging from 0.05 to 0.5 centimeters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dangers arising from the trash/patch&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Apart from reflecting the effect that humankind has had on the Earth, the debris is a serious threat to aquatic life. Fishing nets, which make up about 45% of all the garbage, floating in the debris lead to ‘ghost fishing’, meaning aquatic animals constantly becoming tangled in the nets without anyone at the helm. An estimated 100,000 marine animals are strangled, suffocated, or injured by plastics every year. The sheer amount of trash may even destabilize the fragile ocean ecosystem, impacting seafood and people who eat it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;So, what can we do about the GPGP?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
At the moment, scientists believe that there is no practical way to clean the patch. Charles Moore, the man who discovered the patch, said that cleaning up the patch could “bankrupt entire nations”. &lt;a href=&quot;https://marinedebris.noaa.gov/info/patch.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Marine Debris Program&lt;/a&gt; has estimated that it would take 67 ships a year to clean up less than one percent of the North Pacific Ocean. The area of the North Pacific is 77,010,000 km2. Needless to say, the current population will be long gone before the patch has been cleaned.  It  is a collection of garbage brought in by rivers from multiple countries into the ocean, a mishmash of waste ranging from plastic crates manufactured in the ‘70s to hard hats made in 2010, a multitude of filth, and a timeless reminder that humans do not deserve good things.&lt;br /&gt;
The trash already in the ocean is here to stay for the foreseeable future. We cannot do anything to dispose of  it. What we can do though, is never, ever, dump trash in the ocean. The Earth’s waters cannot and should not handle people’s waste.  It is high time for us to stop treating the Earth as our dumping ground, taking the ravines and plains for granted, for us to stop being nasty.For, as the present situation has demonstrated, when worse comes to worst, even the most powerful find it difficult to catch a breath.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daniel Wang. 07/17/2021&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogs/2021/july/coralOne.png&quot; width=&quot;70%&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin: 0 auto&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;Coral bleaching is the phenomenon in which coral reefs turn white while algae living inside the coral perish. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/science/environment/great-barrier-reef-hit-third-major-bleaching-event-five-years-n1166676&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;(NBC News)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each year, billions of tourists are drawn to the beauty of tropical shores and flock to places such as the Caribbean for vacation. In this age of information, a simple internet search of coral reefs will result in mesmerizing images of sparkling water filled with patches of multiple shades of green. While most may only associate the words “coral reef” with these images, coral reefs aren’t just natural sights, but they are more importantly, ecosystems that humans depend on. At the InterSTEM Speaker Series presentation, Dr. Garen Baghdasarian, a professor of marine biology at Santa Monica College, explained humanity’s dependence on coral reefs as well as the threats to their survival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his presentation, Dr. Baghdasarian first established that coral reefs are indeed organisms. According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.livescience.com/40276-coral-reefs.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;LiveScience&lt;/a&gt;, coral reefs are structures formed from the skeletons of hermatypic coral, a marine invertebrate. Corals have exoskeletons that provide natural protection from underwater threats. In addition, Dr. Baghdasarian mentioned that coral reefs are the building blocks of clear, shallow water ecosystems as they are an energy source that many aquatic organisms depend on for survival. The coral’s  role of being the backbone of aquatic ecosystems is dependent on the symbiotic relationship between the coral and algae. All corals host dinoflagellates, single algae with a flagella that allows the algae to move. The relationship formed between the dinoflagellates and algae allow for the survival of coral in nutrient-sparse areas. The coral will obtain up a large portion of its caloric energy from photosynthetic products made by algae. The algae, on the other hand, will receive micro-nutrients like nitrogen from the corals, as well as an ideal environment for photosynthesis. If this relationship fails, the coral will perish, destabilizing its ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to aquatic ecosystems, many human industries also depend on the sustainability of coral reefs. For example, Dr. Baghdasarian also claims that the tourism brought by coral reefs bring several benefits to a nation’s economy. The reef hosts over 25 million aquatic species, providing food for one billion people. The reefs also act as a carbon sink, mitigating many impacts of rising carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere. Clearly, many aspects of human life depend on services provided by coral reefs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, climate change is posing a threat to the well-being of coral reefs. Dr. Baghdasarian mentioned that over 90 percent of climate change happens in the oceans, directly impacting the health of coral reefs. This leads to the phenomenon of coral “bleaching,” where coral reefs will turn white while algae living inside the corals die. In fact, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/ocean/corals/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;National Ocean Service&lt;/a&gt; explains that small changes in ocean temperature, such as a 2 degree Celsius increase, can ultimately lead the corals to expel the algae living in them and turn white. As Dr. Baghdasarian’s research shows, while the bleaching of a coral does not mean that the coral is dead—some can even recover in 4 weeks in ideal conditions—numerous questions still revolve around the process of coral bleaching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Baghdasarian hopes to answer the question of what will happen to the coral reefs in the future. He and his team began this research by comparing records of coral reefs 50-100 years ago to the coral reefs today. Their observations matched with the general consensus that rising water temperatures led to this catastrophe; as water temperature increased, more algae perished, eventually leading to greater amounts of coral bleaching. Additionally, the increase in water temperature has also seemed to erode tissue of the coral itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One surprising discovery was that in many locations with similar water temperature and pH levels, some corals would be bleached, while others would be completely fine. To find out the reasoning behind this phenomenon, Dr. Baghdasarian compared the different types of symbiotic algae with the hypothesis that some algae may have heat-resistant genes. However, after testing this theory out through his experiments, he concluded that the type of algae was not the factor of coral bleaching as his experimental data showed no correlation between the type of algae present in the coral and the degree of bleaching that the coral experienced. Therefore, Dr. Baghdasarian concluded that traits in the coral reefs themselves determine how severely they bleach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the future, Dr. Baghdasarian will conduct experiments to determine what specific characteristics in corals allow them to thrive in harsh conditions. He believes that in order to protect the coral species, humans must engineer a new species of supercoral that can thrive under more extreme heat conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His final message was that people should never lose hope. No matter how genetically fit human-made coral may be, all work will be done in vain if climate change, the root cause of mass coral bleaching, worsens. Humanity and natural ecosystems are interconnected; while one may not have experienced coral reefs much outside of seeing them in beautiful travel advertisements, the luxuries and benefits one takes from these beautiful organisms depends on their sustainability in the ocean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogs/2021/july/spotifyCover.png&quot; width=&quot;60%&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin: 0 auto&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;Algorithm-based streaming platform Spotify curates personalized playlists for users based on their favorite music &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.spotify.com/us/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;(Spotify)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spotify. As the biggest music streaming platform in the world, Spotify has two main advantages over its competitors: its large and diverse reserves of music consisting of over 70 million songs and its ability to figure out exactly what you want to listen to. Utilizing a search engine that combines multiple machine learning and data analysis models, Spotify collects data from your playlists and then finds similar songs to recommend to you. The personalization of Spotify can be broken down into two main parts: its data infrastructure and personalization algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Data Infrastructure&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Open-source Apache software platforms Kafka, Storm, Crunch, and Cassandra make up the foundation of Spotify. These software systems seamlessly work together to collect and analyze data in real-time and then store it in user profiles as personalized suggestions according to the user’s preference. To make up Spotify’s personalization tech stack (in computing, a stack is a data structure used for storage), a sequence composed of these software systems is run: Kafka collects data, Storm and Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) process the data in real-time, Crunch further processes the data, and everything is stored in Cassandra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogs/2021/july/spotifyOne.png&quot; width=&quot;70%&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin: 0 auto&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;A diagram of data flow in Spotify &lt;a href=&quot;https://engineering.atspotify.com/2015/01/09/personalization-at-spotify-using-cassandra/#:~:text=We%20help%20our%20users%20discover,and%20distastes%20in%20different%20contexts.&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;(Spotify)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Cassandra database, Spotify’s storage unit, consists of over 100 Cassandra clusters, each containing a nested storage system within itself. The sequential layering of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://data-flair.training/blogs/cassandra-cluster/#:~:text=The%20cluster%20is%20a%20collection,storage%20unit%20in%20a%20database.&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;shells&lt;/a&gt; can be represented as follows: cluster → nodes → keyspace → column families→ rows → column. The nodes are made up of computers that share data with each other, and each subsequent shell is a more specific classification of the data in the shell before it. User profile attributes and metadata about playlists and artists are stored in Cassandra clusters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How the Personalization Algorithm Works&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;A popular feature of Spotify is the Discover Weekly playlist, a mixtape of 30 new songs that is updated every Monday. This playlist is the best example of Spotify’s personalization algorithm as its songs are directly determined by Spotify’s discovery engine, a mesh of the three data analysis models Collaborative Filtering, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Audio Analysis. The Collaborative Filtering models rely on data that is stored in immense matrices containing millions of rows and columns, each row representing a user and each column representing a song. After running a matrix factorization formula (with Python libraries) on the user-song matrix, two vectors are produced. The first vector represents a user’s taste in music, and the second vector represents a song’s characteristics. These two vectors are unique to each user, and Spotify recommends songs by comparing your vector to other users’ vectors to find new songs that are similar to the music you are already listening to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogs/2021/july/spotifyTwo.png&quot; width=&quot;70%&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin: 0 auto&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;From left to right: a section of the user--song matrix, a user vector, a song factor &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/s/story/spotifys-discover-weekly-how-machine-learning-finds-your-new-music-19a41ab76efe&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;(Medium)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
While the Collaborative Filtering models analyze data that is solely from Spotify, the NLP models analyze text on the internet about the songs in Spotify’s database, whether it be news articles about popular artists or tweets about new music. The NLP models use &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/docs/analyzing-sentiment&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;sentiment analysis APIs&lt;/a&gt; to create vectors from this collected text that can then be compared to determine if two pieces of music are culturally similar to one another. Finally, audio models analyze the raw audio tracks themselves, an “equalizing” measure built into Spotify’s recommendation models that provide new artists with the same chances of being placed into a user’s Discover Weekly playlist compared to popular artists since audio analysis doesn’t discriminate against song popularity. The audio models use convolutional neural networks to analyze the soundtracks of songs by inputting data as time-frequency representations of audio frames. The frames are then concatenated to form a spectrogram and passed through the convolutional layers of the model, ultimately computing the representative statistics of the song, like the time signature, key, and tempo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogs/2021/july/spotifyThree.png&quot; width=&quot;70%&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin: 0 auto&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where the Discover Weekly Playlist is a representative slice of Spotify’s personalization ability, Spotify’s Home Screen is the whole “personalized experience” pie. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://engineering.atspotify.com/2020/01/16/for-your-ears-only-personalizing-spotify-home-with-machine-learning/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Home Screen&lt;/a&gt; is organized like a bookcase with each shelf (or each horizontal section) displaying your favorite books (the square images that represent playlists, podcasts, artists, albums, etc., more formally known as cards). Each user’s bookcase is different as it is based on their most recent activity, favorite playlists, new releases, and custom mixtapes such as the Discover Weekly Playlist. The cards in each shelf are constantly updated with the help of machine learning. In this case, machine learning can be divided into two sections, exploitation and exploration. Exploitation displays the cards based on your previous activity, whether it be the playlist you last listened to or the artist you started following recently. On the other hand, the exploration aspect is based on initiating user engagement by displaying suggested content, seeing how users respond, and then modifying the suggested content according to user interaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As younger generations can attest, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://magazine.weverse.io/article/view?lang=en&amp;amp;colca=6&amp;amp;num=133&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;music industry&lt;/a&gt; is now centered on  digitally streaming music. For example, the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry’s reports show that music streaming made up 62% of the 2020 global music industry, raking in a grand total of $13.4 billion for artists and labels worldwide. &lt;a href=&quot;https://newsroom.spotify.com/company-info/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt; is at the forefront of this streaming movement with a user community of 356 million people that continues to grow every day. Spotify is necessary for singers to flourish, because their music has the possibility of being recommended to anybody and everybody, thanks to Spotify’s song analysis algorithms. 30% of plays on Spotify are credited to personalized recommendations, which serves as evidence of how Spotify is truly at the intersection of the roads of personalization and technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Spotify continuing to push the boundaries of what music streaming can be, the only limit to the music industry is our imagination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogs/2021/july/resourcesOne.jpg&quot; width=&quot;70%&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin: 0 auto&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;Coal mines in Columbia &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/content/6-natural-resources-exploited-on-earth/?template=next&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;(Scott Wallace/World Bank)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have probably heard doomsday warnings such as “climate change will be irreversible by 2030” or “fossil fuels will run out by 2060” to the point that the end of humanity seems inevitable and quickly approaching. But is it true? There is a common theme for these predictions - depletion of natural resources, that humanity’s overconsumption will be its downfall - but what’s actually going on? How can an entire planet run out of resources so quickly?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know that there is only a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rd.com/list/what-would-happen-if-worlds-natural-resources-ran-out/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;finite amount&lt;/a&gt; of soil, fossil fuels, water, heavy metals, and minerals on Earth, so we must run out eventually, right? And it is true that as a species, we are using these finite resources very quickly; between 1950 and 2000, humans have consumed more natural resources than over the course of all of previous human history, and scientists have been warning against overconsumption since the 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientists’ predictions for what the future will bring have consistently changed, despite having known about overconsumption for years. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/jul/07/research.waste&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2002 report from the World Wildlife Fund&lt;/a&gt; claimed we would have to colonize at least 2 Earth-sized planets by 2050 to make up for the rate at which we use up natural resources. Now, in 2021, this prediction is less popular because we know that it is neither realistically possible nor necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the numbers seem to be against us, we’re still alive, and the fuel, soil, and minerals that we use everyday never seem to run out. The Club of Rome’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://wattsupwiththat.com/2019/05/15/why-resources-arent-natural-and-will-never-run-out/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Limits to Growth&lt;/a&gt; manifesto, written in 1972, predicted that we would have already run out of heavy metals such as gold, copper, mercury, silver, and zinc by now, but we haven’t. In fact, they’re quite common and used on a daily basis. So what does this mean? Were the scientists wrong? Not quite…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To “run out” of something really means there will be none left for us to use, not necessarily none left in the entire world. But why does that matter? Well, Earth is much bigger than you might think, and there are plenty of natural resources on it we could use, but reaching them is another story. There are smaller, less dense pockets of ores and minerals deep beneath the Earth’s surface, but reaching them would be too expensive and only considered when we have already depleted all the other, more easily accessible deposits and have no easier options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To say we will run out of resources fails to account for new technology. Resource availability is not determined by the finite amount of the resource, but by our ability to obtain it. Historically, technology needs to advance to extract a greater amount of resources, and we don’t have any reason to assume this won’t keep happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can we be sure that technology will advance at an effective rate? Well, in many ways, it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.discovermagazine.com/planet-earth/the-world-is-running-out-of-elements-and-researchers-are-looking-in-unlikely&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;already is&lt;/a&gt;. Ore mines have expanded to the arctic in recent years and plans for deep sea mining operations and asteroid mining are underway for the more distant future. Heavy metals can be recycled from electronic waste, and elements such as nitrogen are extracted from the atmosphere to produce fertilizer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So will we ever really run out of resources? In short: no, or at least not anytime soon. The earth is far from actually “running out” of the resources we depend on. As time passes they will just become more and more expensive as their extraction becomes less convenient, eventually being replaced by cheaper, reusable options when the cost becomes too ridiculous for continued use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this outlook does not take into consideration the full picture of what is going on in the world. It is important to point out that for the general public to make the switch to renewable resources, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://welcome.arcadia.com/energy-101/energy-sources/will-we-ever-actually-run-out-of-fossil-fuels&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;cost of non-renewable resources&lt;/a&gt; must rise enough to outweigh the cost of renewable ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can see this happening today: renewable energy sources such as solar or wind already exist, but they are not used nearly as much as fossil fuels, because the cost of extracting fossil fuels is cheap compared to green energy. As fossil fuels become more difficult and costly to obtain, oil prices will rise and consumers will turn to renewable energy, making it widespread and more affordable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But from the perspective of those living in poverty, their world will run out of resources long before this point. While 1st world countries can still afford the rising oil prices and do not yet feel the need to transition to green energy, 3rd world countries will be unable to afford either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, our current rate of consumption may not cause the Earth to deplete its resources anytime soon, but it does have drastic consequences on the environment. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7341033/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Global warming is a much larger issue&lt;/a&gt; than depletion of natural resources, and if we don’t do something, it will likely bring &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencealert.com/un-warns-of-biological-annihilation-up-to-a-million-animal-could-soon-be-extinct&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;our downfall&lt;/a&gt; long before we run out of natural resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goal is not to downplay the costs of human exploitation of the environment, but to create a more accurate, less self-centered view of what is happening. We are certainly not destroying the Earth; our home planet has been through much worse and will carry on long after we’re gone, although how it appears on the surface may be quite different. Whether or not we will be included in its future depends on what we do next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Antibiotic resistance has become a pivotal topic for biomedical research in recent years. Its ability to hinder advancements in drug development makes it one of the biggest threats to public health. Each year, approximately 2.8 million people in the United States develop an infection due to antibiotic resistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In simple terms, antibiotics are chemicals that inhibit the growth of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. They accomplish this by either directly killing the microorganism or by stopping its reproduction long enough for the host’s immune system to kick in. To better understand the various components of the immune system, it’s important to first discuss the human microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The human microbiome refers to the sum of all the microorganisms, or microbes, living in the human body. These microbes include eukaryotes, bacteria, archaea, and viruses. Research indicates that there are about ten times as many microbial cells as there are human cells. While it may seem surprising that microbes are such an important part of the body–after all, antibiotics are meant to target them–it is important to note that not all microbes are the same; some are harmful while others are beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The microbiome is closely linked to the immune system. According to the journal &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-020-0332-7&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Cell Research&lt;/a&gt;, “The microbiome plays critical roles in the training and development of major components of the host’s innate and adaptive immune system, while the immune system orchestrates the maintenance of key features of host-microbe symbiosis.” In other words,  the microbiome and immune system have a mutually beneficial relationship because they rely on each other to operate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The immune system is responsible for getting rid of pathogens, or disease-causing microbes. White blood cells are one of the most important parts of the immune system. Certain types of white blood cells, namely B and T lymphocytes, are memory cells, meaning they remember a pathogen after its first invasion and produce antibodies, proteins that protect against pathogens, much more quickly in subsequent infections. These cells are part of the acquired immune system, which changes throughout an organism’s life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Different from the adaptive immune system,  the acquired immune system is inherited at birth and remains unchanged over time. During a pathogenic infection, the innate immune system sends phagocytes, a type of cell that can engulf bacteria and particles, to attack the invading cells. Through these mechanisms, both the innate and acquired immune systems work together to ward off pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Antibiotics often work in conjunction with the immune system to prevent the spread of pathogens. One well-known antibiotic is penicillin, which is used to treat staphylococci and streptococci bacterial infections. The former is a skin infection that typically results from an open wound or surgery, while the latter is a mouth/throat infection. Penicillin works by damaging bacterial cell walls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A vital aspect of such antibiotic development is ensuring that they don’t harm people. Since humans lack cell walls, they are unaffected by penicillin treatment. According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.news-medical.net/health/Penicillin-Mechanism.aspx&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;News Medical&lt;/a&gt;, “Penicillin kills bacteria through binding of the beta-lactam ring to DD-transpeptidase, inhibiting its cross-linking activity and preventing new cell wall formation.” To put it simply, by binding to an enzyme (DD-transpeptidase), penicillin forms a highly stable intermediate that prevents the enzyme from functioning, which ultimately inhibits cell wall formation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Antibiotic resistance is caused by genetic mutations in bacteria, which are more prone to mutations due to their rapid rate of reproduction. When bacteria reproduce in the vicinity of antibiotics, already present mutations that allow them to be resistant are passed onto future generations, eventually leading to the evolution of a resistant strain. Hence, the antibiotic becomes ineffective, and a stronger one is needed. Over time, as this cycle continues and  antibiotics become stronger, their production will become impractical. Even more worrisome is the fact that “bacterial strains can become resistant to more than one antibiotic, leading to the creation of ‘superbugs’ that are extremely difficult to treat.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogs/2021/july/antibioticTwo.jpg&quot; width=&quot;70%&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin: 0 auto&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.infextioustherapeutic.com/programs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;(Infextious Therapeutic)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bacteria achieve resistance to antibiotics through various mechanisms. Penicillin resistance, for example, was the direct result of bacterial production of beta-lactamase, an enzyme that harms the beta-lactam ring. Without it, penicillin is no longer capable of damaging bacterial cells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As time goes on, antibiotic resistance and the creation of superbugs has become more widespread. Fortunately, awareness of the issue has also increased and scientists are developing new methods to combat antibiotic resistance. One such method is focusing attention on natural antibiotics rather than artificial ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientists from the Institute for Stem Cell Science and Regenerative Medicine have been doing just this. As outlined by &lt;a href=&quot;https://phys.org/news/2019-12-scientists-method-combat-antibiotic-resistant-bacteria.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;phys.org&lt;/a&gt;, “the team probed the cellular mechanisms that regulate the release of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), which are natural antibiotics produced by skin cells to fight off bacteria.” What makes AMPs unique is that they attack bacteria in ways that make resistance to them very difficult. By understanding the mechanisms used by AMPs, researchers may be able to develop antibiotics that replicate them. Moreover, the research has already led to a groundbreaking discovery: skin cells utilize a signaling pathway that regulates how AMPs are released, meaning that by altering these pathways, scientists can allow the AMPs to be released without being exposed to the bacteria at all. This could potentially help groups of people that are in greater danger of infection, including those with a weak immune system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogs/2021/july/biasOne.png&quot; width=&quot;70%&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin: 0 auto&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;Facial recognition technology works by recognizing and matching up key points on a person’s face, as shown in the picture. However, people of color in particular face much higher error rates with this software. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aclu.org/news/privacy-technology/how-is-face-recognition-surveillance-technology-racist/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;(ACLU)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
For years, bias in policing and law enforcement has been a fiercely debated issue. Last year, the death of George Floyd provoked immense outcry, resulting in resurgences of the Black Lives Matter movement and calls for radical reformation of the criminal justice system. However, while there has been extensive discussion of the implicit biases and discriminatory actions of human police officers, few recognize the other segment of law enforcement in desperate need of reform: facial recognition technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of us interact with facial recognition on a daily basis in relatively benign ways, such as unlocking our phones or tagging our friends in a post on social media. However, on a broader scale, this software is used in everything from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facefirst.com/blog/amazing-uses-for-face-recognition-facial-recognition-use-cases/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;recognizing known criminals to diagnosing certain diseases.&lt;/a&gt; As the use of AI technology has expanded, so too have concerns about the potential biases in the software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2020/racial-discrimination-in-face-recognition-technology/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Harvard University’s Science in the News&lt;/a&gt;, while facial recognition boasts an impressive accuracy rate for certain groups, the technology is plagued by a far higher rate of errors among young, Black, and female subjects. In 2018, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://proceedings.mlr.press/v81/buolamwini18a/buolamwini18a.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;“Gender Shades” project&lt;/a&gt; offered strong experimental proof of this bias. The algorithms tested in the experiment showed up to 34% higher error rates for darker-skinned female subjects than for lighter-skinned males, putting a global spotlight on the implications of using facial recognition technology. A year later, a federal study further showed egregious disparities on the basis of race, gender, and age. For instance, “Asian and African American people were up to 100 times more likely to be misidentified than white men,” according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/12/19/federal-study-confirms-racial-bias-many-facial-recognition-systems-casts-doubt-their-expanding-use/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;. Other minority groups, women, the elderly, and children were all subject to drastically higher rates of inaccuracy than middle-aged Caucasian men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The implications of these biases are staggering. As pointed out by Jay Stanley of the American Civil Liberties Union, “One false match can lead to missed flights, lengthy interrogations, tense police encounters, false arrests, or worse.” In the realm of law enforcement in particular, not only is the technology itself biased, but there are several compounding factors that further disadvantage Black and Brown people. Many jurisdictions in the U.S. use mugshot databases to train facial recognition algorithms, subjecting the technology to prejudice of years past. As &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aclu.org/news/privacy-technology/how-is-face-recognition-surveillance-technology-racist/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the American Civil Liberties Union&lt;/a&gt; explains, “Since Black people are more likely to be arrested than white people for minor crimes… their faces and personal data are more likely to be in mugshot databases. Therefore, the use of face recognition technology tied into mugshot databases exacerbates racism in the criminal legal system that already disproportionately polices and criminalizes Black people.” Moreover, there is a higher proportion of surveillance cameras installed in predominantly Black and Brown neighborhoods, further influencing the accuracy of facial recognition algorithms that process surveillance footage. Ultimately, these realities boil down to an undeniable truth: facial recognition is contributing to inequality in everything from suspect identification to alibi corroboration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This naturally begs the question: how can the world of facial recognition be improved? The primary solution is &lt;a href=&quot;https://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2020/racial-discrimination-in-face-recognition-technology/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;improving training datasets&lt;/a&gt;. When facial recognition algorithms are created, they are “trained” on large databases of various people’s faces. However, these datasets are often lacking in diversity. The underrepresentation of Black, Brown, female, and young subjects in these datasets makes it harder for the algorithms to differentiate between darker-skinned female subjects. As a result, many are calling for algorithms to be trained on more representative and comprehensive datasets. Other solutions include establishing standards of image quality for people of all skin colors, regular auditing, and new legislation to regulate how mass surveillance is conducted and how law enforcement officers use the technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facial recognition software is undeniably a powerful tool with great potential. The inherent bias in the technology is certainly not a reason to scrap it altogether. Rather, the facial recognition landscape must be transformed into a tool for equality and justice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;https://maxton.xyz/blog/online-jamming-jamulus-reaper&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;(Maxton)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The global pandemic has closed schools and other locations across the country, forcing the music industry, along with others, to use technology to preserve their way of life. For one group in particular, musicians, this transition has been especially difficult. While business meetings can carry on in a more or less normal format through Zoom and other communication technologies, musicians require being able to hear one another in real-time, as they use their ears to fit in with the musical ensemble. If it seems hard to not interrupt people when simply talking on Zoom, imagine trying to achieve precisely timed entrances that are hard to coordinate even without the added complications of slow internet. This issue has made many people ask the question, “How can we have the technology to send humans into space and communicate with them but not the technology to produce one of man’s most basic forms of expression, music?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, it turns out we do have that ability; we simply need to look a little deeper. One of these technologies actually allows musicians to play virtually with almost no delay. Although other iterations exist, one of the main areas this function exists is in Jamulus, an application that runs on a computer and allows musicians to hear each other by compiling the sounds into a server. While it is helpful to set up a private server that can host a specific group, especially if a group meets regularly, it is not necessary. Many servers are public, allowing anyone from around the world to join them and are therefore a great meeting place for a group, provided that you click the solo option to ensure that no one breaks up a rehearsal. Another application of Jamulus occurs when a group has rehearsed enough that they can put on a concert live online from their own houses. This also requires the use of Zoom (to display video), open broadcast software, YouTube live and someone to manage all of this. Of course, there are limitations to this, which means that most people using Jamulus will need to use an ethernet cable to minimize the overall delay and ping time so that this automation is actually useful. There is also the possibility of a technological failure, such as a server crash or downed internet, but overall the benefits of this server certainly outweigh the negative aspects, especially while people are not comfortable or safely able to congregate and play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other option is to not play live at all, but rather record each part individually and place them all together to form a piece. This requires a click track, which the musician can line themselves up with, as well as background music and a clear start time in each video so that it is clear when the piece starts. Unfortunately, it is not this simple because as any musician will tell you when playing in a group, it isn’t just about one person playing correctly, but it’s about the musician fitting into the correct sound of a group. As such, audio engineering will say that lining up the audio portions of each person will make the Los Angeles Philharmonic sound like a sixth-grade orchestra. However, by using technologies such as GarageBand, Audacity or other audio editors, audio engineers can do anything from splitting tapes and shifting the time between each note to changing the pitch of that note altogether. The result is a soundtrack that reflects or even enhances the abilities of the live ensemble. This choice was often the preferred method of large ensembles or school groups, as technologies such as Jamulus lag with too many people online. Additionally, schools may not be able to provide everyone with the appropriate amount of technology to run Jamulus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with these technologies, it is hard to replicate the sound of a live performance through an old built-in computer or phone microphone. These microphones were made to pick up vocal sounds and often distort the sounds of instruments, especially loud brass sounds. This created a whole new market for external microphones which were once rare. There are two main types of microphones: dynamic, and condenser, each with its pros and cons. Dynamic microphones are more capable of withstanding loud sounds, while condenser microphones are better at picking up the intricacies of soft sounds but cannot deal with loud sounds well. These microphones have definitely become more popular over the past year, but many musicians, especially inexperienced ones, have decided that their computer or phone microphone better suit their needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the exact sound of a live performance can’t be replicated online, which is why concerts are still a popular phenomenon even though any song can be accessed for free on online platforms such as YouTube. Still, with the addition of softwares such as Jamulus, audio editing softwares, and microphones, musical performances have been able to continue throughout the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
