&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It’s a clear spring night, and you decide to go stargazing with some friends. You gather some pillows, blankets and board games, laying them on the lawn grass. Laying down on the cushions, you see some faint stars in the distance, nothing too unusual. Hoping to perhaps see a shooting star, your eyes rapidly jerk up in response to what looks like a link of stars traveling through the night sky. Not 10 or 20, rather 100 or 200 rapidly beaming circles rushing in and out of your view. You turn to your friends, who look anything but worried about what you perceive as a potential alien invasion, instead calmly admiring the crazy view. “Starlink, huh?” one exclaims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is Starlink? Well, it is no alien invasion, rather a movement of satellites that stream around Earth at all times. Get lucky, and you may even see them making their way around your home. Though simply aesthetically pleasing to some, these futuristic-looking sky sequins serve an important purpose: giving everyone on Earth access to faster Internet speeds and data. But, of course, they also obstruct an astronomer’s view, which is more controversial than you may think! In the latest Starlink launch on Jan. 20, SpaceX reached the large 1,000 satellite mark, totaling 1,015 beams of light fluttering across the sky. Though this may already seem like an impressively large number, SpaceX founder and CEO &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/how-elon-musk-42000-starlink-satellites-earth-effects-stars-2020-10&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Elon Musk&lt;/a&gt;, is nowhere near finished, as he wants to include at least another 41,000 satellites to the bunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the capabilities of wireless satellites, Musk desires to cut out the lag often associated with typical telecommunications products, providing a profit for not only those companies if successful, but also for SpaceX. The satellites will be at different proximities to Earth, as this allows the greatest range and network efficiency for individuals around the globe. The first satellite was launched in May 2019, and the first set had a successful altitude launch of 340 miles from the ground. Starlink serves to create faster proximities of Internet speed, and it will work up to a gigabit per second with a latency of 25 to 35 milliseconds, with 5 trillion bytes a day of data generated as of June 2020. For comparison, the speeds that Starlink will eventually offer stand &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@ankushborkar/starlink-vs-5g-f69b1dcdd8ab&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;10 times faster than typical 4G networks, but not as fast as 5G&lt;/a&gt;. Starlink has a goal to serve individuals who may struggle to find good connections due to their geographic location, a number Musk estimates to be between 3% to 4% of the world population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may be curious as to what operating system SpaceX uses to control Starlink. Currently, the network system known as Linux is being put into full force, with each satellite &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/5-trillion-bytes-day-spacex-232141318.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;containing around 4,000 Linux computers&lt;/a&gt;. Linux is no stranger in the world of networking and communication; it has been an open-source operating system in use since 1991. Linux has had a rivalry with Windows operating systems, such as Windows 10, with Linux claiming it runs &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/linux-vs-windows/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;“faster and smoother” than its counterpart.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SpaceX’s project is one of innovation; however, they are not the only company with an equally ambitious project. &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@ankushborkar/starlink-vs-5g-f69b1dcdd8ab&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Companies like Vodafone, Samsung and even Amazon’s Blue Origin&lt;/a&gt; rocket launching company are currently striving to create similar satellite networks, attempting to provide the internet to more people than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though these competitors may bring out full-force systems similar to Starlink in the future, for now, we can all credit that nightly-chain of rapidly expanding ‘stars’ to none other than SpaceX.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fermi’s Paradox states that there is an apparent contradiction between lack of alien encounters and the highly probable chance of their existence.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quantamagazine.org/galaxy-simulations-offer-a-new-solution-to-the-fermi-paradox-20190307/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;(Quanta Magazine)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Water. Where the start and end of alien life occurs. You may think that water is highly limited, maybe even to just our own Earth, but actually, we’ve discovered tons of it. Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe, and oxygen is the third most abundant (the second most is helium, which is highly unreactive). Thus, when these elements come into close contact with each other, they form water. According to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation#:~:text=The%20Drake%20equation%20is%20a,in%20the%20Milky%20Way%20galaxy.&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Drake Equation&lt;/a&gt;, the numerical range for the number of aliens in the universe can range from one to tens of millions. With such a large range, we would expect to have made some contact with a higher intelligence being, but we haven’t. This is exactly what &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enrico_Fermi&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Enrico Fermi&lt;/a&gt; was thinking when he came up with Fermi’s Paradox, which states the contradiction between the lack of alien encounters and the high chance of their existence. This lead Fermi to ask one question (and maybe the one you’re thinking right now): where is everybody?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are multiple ways to approach this. According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdqcVjCe0bc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Aperture&lt;/a&gt;, one of those ways was proposed by Robin Hanson. He figured that we’ve been asking the wrong question: instead of expecting that the universe should be filled with human life forms, he thought that we should accept that life is extremely rare and our time might be limited. If he is right, we have miscalculated the steps necessary to create life, either in difficulty or correctness. Through this re-consideration of our objectives for life, we created the Great Filter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Great Filter could be anything in the timeline that created humans. It could be whatever started abiogenesis (the origin of life), the first proper replication of DNA with enough mutations that it caused evolution, the first creation of organized eukaryotic cells or even the creation of a moon to cause a proper atmosphere. It could be anything. Well, we passed it. We made it past the Great Filter. Give yourself a pat on the back…but, what if it’s ahead of us?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if there was life teeming in the universe that was killed by a filter that exceeds our current position in time? Maybe we will witness the Great Filter when the Andromeda Galaxy smashes into our own, and we get pushed into the darkness of space. The concept behind the Great Filter is that maybe life had grown in a different place in the universe, but was never able to grow to an intergalactic scale because of some major event that wiped it out. Some relatively recent events that humanity has endured that had the potential to be the Great Filter are coronal mass ejections, a geomagnetic storm from the sun, a large meteor and a global pandemic. Just some of the ways humanity could meet its end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the idea of the Great Filter is extremely flawed, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/greatfilter.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Robin Hanson&lt;/a&gt;. We are extrapolating this entire theory from a single data point: Earth. This is the only data point for life that we’ve ever known. What if other life forms don’t have a colonialist mindset and don’t want to find other planets with life? What if, instead of water, aliens live off of liquid mercury? The extrapolation of every variable is extremely hard to take into account when it’s all just based on speculation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe there isn’t any Great Filter and the lack of life elsewhere just shows that our existence is a coincidence, and we are simply lucky. We are lucky to understand our reality. We are lucky that the universe is so fine-tuned for our existence - from our location in the solar system to the abundance of water. Maybe we are the only ones in our universe and we’re lucky to be here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Avoiding pain and seeking pleasure are the two most basic principles humans pursue. But if we think about it, occasionally, people seek pleasure in order to evade pain. It’s fascinating to acknowledge that human nature amounts to something as simple as this. But what if someone can’t feel the pain to begin with? Imagine never having to experience the immense pain that comes along with breaking a bone. It could be described as every person’s dream come true, but it’s actually a curse in disguise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Importance of Pain&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sensation of pain protects humans from the damaging effects of dangerous stimuli and is therefore critical for the well-being of the organism. It’s important to point out, however, that pain shouldn’t be merely regarded as a form of perception, but rather a motivation to act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20170426-the-people-who-never-feel-any-pain&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ingo Kurth&lt;/a&gt;, a doctor at the Institute of Human Genetics in Aachen, Germany, “We fear pain, but in developmental terms from being a child to being a young adult, pain is incredibly important to the process of learning how to modulate your physical activity without doing damage to your bodies, and in determining how much risk you take.”
According to psychologists, pain consists of three dimensions or components that work as a unit in order to deliver perceptual information that eventually affects the motor processes characterizing pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first dimension is the sensory-discriminative, which allows the individual to assess the intensity, location, duration and nature of the pain. A disruption to this dimension would lead to insensitivity to pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then comes the effective-motivational component. This component provides psychological responses like irritation, anxiety and fear that motivate people to get their bodies out of danger. A malfunction in this dimension would result in indifference to pain.
The final dimension is the cognitive-evaluative, which is the brain’s evaluation of the input in terms of past experiences and its appraisal regarding the probability of different response strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How do healthy individuals sense pain?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogs/2021/january/painTwo.png&quot; width=&quot;60%&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin: 0 auto&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;This figure demonstrates the general pathway of the pain sensation.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brainfacts.org/thinking-sensing-and-behaving/touch/2012/touch-and-pain&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;(BrainFacts)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Tissue damage caused by a hot object, as an example, is detected by pain receptors (nociceptors) in the skin, each of which forms on one end of a neuron. When the nociceptor is activated, it sends an electrical signal to the spinal cord through the nerve fiber.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within an area of the spinal cord called the dorsal horn, the electrical signals are transmitted to the brain from one neuron to another through synapses by releasing neurotransmitters, which are essentially chemical messengers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the brain, the signals reach the thalamus, which then conveys them to different parts of the brain. Signals are sent to the somatosensory cortex (responsible for physical sensation), the frontal cortex (in charge of thinking) and the limbic system (related to emotions).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, a person would feel the sensation and respond emotionally to the pain by feeling irritated, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, by this time, the individual would have most likely already reacted involuntarily through a reflex response that occurs within the spinal cord. They would have shifted their hand away from the heat source mere milliseconds before the brain actually became aware of the pain sensation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is Congenital insensitivity to pain (CIP)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congenital insensitivity to pain is an umbrella term used to describe hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies (HSANs), which are rare autosomal recessive disorders characterized by the absence of pain sensation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are caused by mutations in the SCN9A gene, responsible for encoding a voltage-gated sodium channel that plays a significant role in nociceptive signaling. Both gain and loss of function mutations have been reported. For example, mutations that amplify this gene’s function causes autosomal dominant disorders characterized by extreme pain, whereas mutations that diminish the SCN9A gene’s function cause congenital insensitivity to pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although CIP has a long history, it was not until recently that reports of individuals who showed CIP actually attracted medical attention. Scientists realized that probing into this rare disorder may offer a new understanding of pain itself, which in turn could help them better treat patients subjected to chronic pain conditions.
Patients with CIP do not seem to notice sensations of pain; that is, they have a noticeably compromised ability to perceive the intensity and quality of painful stimuli. They can sense the difference between sharp and dull sensations but cannot discern temperatures, and thus won’t notice - for example - something as typical as a hot beverage burning their tongue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Young children with congenital insensitivity to pain typically have various wounds resulting from self-mutilation, like biting their lips and fingers, in addition to multiple burn-related injuries. The accumulation of these injuries usually results in a reduced life span in individuals with this condition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is believed that the reason this condition is so rare is because of the fact that very few patients dealing with congenital insensitivity to pain actually reach adulthood.
Congenital insensitivity to pain is closely associated with congenital indifference to pain, in which painful stimuli are perceived but there is an absence of the effective response to pain, rather than a lack of signal transmission. While these individuals report experiencing sensations of pain, they display no inclination to evade the painful stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the absence of the body’s natural warning mechanism, many individuals with congenital insensitivity to pain display - albeit unintentionally - self-destructive behaviors as children. To put it simply, pain is indispensable for survival. By sensing it, a person is able to tell when and where their body needs further care and attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;This illustration ties into the origins of the word ‘personality.’ The person alternating between two different masks is exactly what the actors did a long time ago to warrant the original Latin inspiration for the word. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;amp;v=dcsc_EsJmsA&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;(Practical Psychology)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A person’s personality has a tremendous impact on their life. It affects their interests, aspirations, likes, dislikes and various other aspects of their being. Because of its large influence, it has an entire branch of psychology dedicated to learning more about it. This branch, known as personality psychology, aims to understand &lt;a href=&quot;https://mypages.unh.edu/jdmayer/personality-scientific-discipline&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a person’s psychological tendencies&lt;/a&gt; and how they are displayed in everyday life. This field has been growing ever since it was established back in Ancient Greece, and many discoveries relating to personality have been made due to its expansion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a brief history, the word ‘personality’ comes from the Latin word ‘persona.’ A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.betterhelp.com/advice/psychologists/all-about-personality-psychology-definition-and-examples/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;persona&lt;/a&gt; was defined as a mask worn by actors when they were up on stage; those masks needed to be changed multiple times throughout a performance, as shown in the illustration above. This might be taken as someone changing how they present themselves to the world, which can also extend to the way people shift their personalities around certain people. Eventually, the word ‘persona’ gave way into ‘personality.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fascination with this subject gave way to several different theories of how personality came to be. One of these theories is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.verywellmind.com/the-big-five-personality-dimensions-2795422&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the Big Five theory&lt;/a&gt;, which states that everyone has five universal personality traits. These traits are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/conscientiousness&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;conscientiousness&lt;/a&gt; (wanting to excel in everything), &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/agreeableness&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;agreeableness&lt;/a&gt; (appearing to be kind and friendly), &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.verywellmind.com/how-openness-influences-your-behavior-4796351&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;openness&lt;/a&gt; (being aware of inner feelings and desires), &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-extroversion-2795994&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;extraversion&lt;/a&gt; (getting enjoyment outside of things related to the individual directly) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/neuroticism&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;neuroticism&lt;/a&gt; (ability to be emotional, which correlates to feelings of anxiety, fears and anger among much more). These traits are on a spectrum for everyone, with certain traits being stronger than others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other theories include &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.verywellmind.com/personality-psychology-4157179&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Freud’s theory of sexual development and Erik Erikson’s eight psychosocial stages of life&lt;/a&gt;. Freud’s theory focuses on how different erogenous zones impact development until adulthood, and Erikson’s theory centers on the idea that each stage of life is plagued by a huge psychosocial event, with this event having either a positive or negative outcome on the individual. While the former can be seen as more ‘risqué’ compared to the latter, both are very similar as they both entail that people go through different stages of development throughout their lives. These two theories state that by the end of this long developmental period, people become fully developed and are ready to be an adult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to mention the personality types that have been observed since the field’s inception. There are about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.16personalities.com/personality-types&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;16 personality types in total&lt;/a&gt;, all of which are based on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.verywellmind.com/the-myers-briggs-type-indicator-2795583&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;variety of certain traits&lt;/a&gt;. Some of these include sensing, perceiving, feeling and extroversion. The traits dictate someone’s personality, and each type has its own set of strong traits. Each personality has an acronym, an example being &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.16personalities.com/intj-personality&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;INTJ&lt;/a&gt;, which means the person has Introverted, Intuitive, Thinking and Judging personality traits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another discovery pertains to the fact that these 16 personalities have two types. These types, Assertive and Turbulent, dictate how the person’s personality will be exhibited. For example, an Assertive INTJ will be more outspoken and commanding, while a Turbulent INTJ will be more laid back and quiet. They are still both INTJ, but they showcase their personalities and traits in different ways. Think of it as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.16personalities.com/articles/assertive-architect-intj-a-vs-turbulent-architect-intj-t&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Assertive types being more on the frontline, while Turbulent types are more to the side&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these discoveries, it is easy to understand why some people get along with others so well. There are obviously a variety of other reasons, &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelearning.ucl.ac.uk/resources/personality-affects-work-behaviour-career-success/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;but their similar personalities definitely play a part in making it easy to bond and thrive with one another&lt;/a&gt;. When people with similar personalities are around each other, it is likely they will benefit each other as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogs/2021/january/psychologyTwo.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;60%&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin: 0 auto&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;This illustrates how each person has their own unique personality, as well as how they all have the ability to influence other similar or different personality types. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dmitstudio.com/blog/key-factors-analyzing-mental-status-examination-career-counselling-adhd-cases/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;(DMIT Studio)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Even with the positive ways that personalities can influence each other, they can also have a negative impact. Some of the problems are mild like simply not getting along with someone, while some others are more serious and involve a degree of pettiness and general annoyance. It all depends on whether or not the different types are compatible. Luckily, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.truity.com/page/personality-type-interactions-compatibility&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;there are various ways&lt;/a&gt; to figure out if a person with a certain personality might get along with someone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other negative aspects of personality psychology include personality disorders. Characterized as mental disorders that can seriously impact a person’s functioning and wellbeing, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.verywellmind.com/personality-psychology-4157179&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;personality disorders&lt;/a&gt; are a broad field. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.verywellmind.com/personality-disorders-a2-425427&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Categorized into three clusters&lt;/a&gt;, the different personality disorders are grouped together depending on their similarities. The first cluster, Cluster A, has disorders that are known to be strange or eccentric. Examples of these can be paranoid personality disorder and schizoid personality disorder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The personality disorders in the second cluster, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.verywellmind.com/the-cluster-b-personality-disorders-425429&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Cluster B&lt;/a&gt;, are grouped together due to their similar dramatic nature. Disorders in this cluster include antisocial personality disorder and narcissistic personality disorder. The last cluster, Cluster C, has disorders that are linked together by their emphasis on extreme anxiety. Some of these are avoidant personality disorder and dependent personality disorder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Potentially not bonding with someone of a differing personality type is already bad on its own depending on how a person looks at it, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.verywellmind.com/personality-disorders-a2-425427&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;personality disorders cause a slew of additional issues&lt;/a&gt;. They can prevent people from bonding well with others at all, strain pre-existing relationships, make people extremely nervous all the time or in need of constant reassurance from those who care, among many more side effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A personality psychology professional can examine these symptoms and their longevity, eventually deciding whether or not to diagnose a person with a certain disorder. Before they can do that though, they need to decide on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.verywellmind.com/provisional-diagnosis-vs-differential-diagnosis-1067284&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;differential diagnosis&lt;/a&gt;. This entails the professional determining if these symptoms are not the cause of other mental disorders or medical conditions. From there, sufficient treatment for the patient is decided on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personality psychology is an interesting and expanding field. It has come a long way since researchers first started examining it more closely, and it is now one of the most popular fields of psychology. It also happens to be one of the most complex as well. Numerous discoveries have been made, and the world understands how humans work a lot more due to these breakthroughs. As humans continue to evolve, so will personality psychology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogs/2021/january/vaccineOne.png&quot; width=&quot;40%&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin: 0 auto&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://coronavirus.utah.gov/vaccine/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;(Utah.gov)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Normality. A concept that has been seemingly destroyed by a global pandemic for almost 10 months. With 21st-century science innovation and unlimited funding, many expected a quick solution to the problems that have pierced the lives of millions. However, science cannot be rushed, as safety and surrounding logistics still linger during the initial inoculation process of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. Many individuals wonder when they’ll get the vaccine, and this evidently depends on one’s surrounding resources, location, vocation and risk for contracting the virus. Below is a detailed, yet estimated timeline for when vaccines will be distributed throughout 2021, and when individuals can be expected to return back to emerging feelings of “normalcy”: slowly, but surely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though COVID-19 vaccines are not accessible to everyone as of January 2021, mid-December marked the healthcare worker rollout. This makes sense, as healthcare workers have been risking their lives every day to care for firsthand COVID-19 patients. However, there is another group of early vaccinators that have been receiving backlash for their place within this timeline. Older Americans who reside in nursing homes have been another high-risk category that has received vaccine doses in large quantities. According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/05/health/covid-vaccine-first.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;, choosing which group to prioritize has been a large issue, as it is often a debate of ‘human preservation’ versus ‘the slowing rate of spread.’ Though healthcare workers are an integral part of the essential work-force, there are also thousands of other Americans providing services in grocery stores and restaurants, sectors that are considered essential to keep American families in check. So far, there has been an increasing amount of support for placing essential workers before senior citizens and instead putting elder citizens at a subphase, known as phase 1b of the vaccination treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With numerous first-responders being vaccinated with either one or both doses today, there is a new phase, which started in late December and ends mid-January, that encompasses a larger population of individuals. Of course, essential healthcare workers who were not a part of this initial phase are included, but high-risk persons, K-12 teachers and nurses who work in long-term facilities have also been added into the mix. The teachers receiving the COVID-19 vaccine primarily contain those who are a part of districts that resumed in-person learning. Though most schools are in locations classified as red tiered, meaning a greater risk of infection, some schools have stayed open as early as October, thus qualifying teachers to &lt;a href=&quot;https://edsource.org/2021/some-california-teachers-and-staff-to-receive-covid-19-vaccines-beginning-this-week/646526&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;receive vaccinations during this beginning phase&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though most shipped vaccines will be put to use, there will always be a few outliers: vaccines that aren’t put to use. With these extras, California governor Gavin Newson plans to remain flexible, administering the extra doses to other essential works, such as food and agricultural workers, teachers or additional healthcare workers. No vaccine dosage will go to waste! Though a possibility, there will likely be few extra vaccines, considering that there are pandemic centers in California like Los Angeles that are in dire need of protection for their many healthcare workers forced to work longer shifts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all healthcare and essential workers have received the vaccine, it would be time to distribute it to senior citizens, those over the age of 65. This would be known as phase 1c, likely encompassing one of the larger groups of qualified patients. Although this phase does encompass all senior citizens, the highest priority would go to those who are immunocompromised, meaning that going out every day and returning to normal life would be an even greater risk than before. Although there is no set time for this phase’s subsection, &lt;a href=&quot;https://whyy.org/articles/when-will-it-be-your-turn-to-get-the-coronavirus-vaccine-heres-a-guide/#&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;experts expect this wave to occur&lt;/a&gt; around March or April of 2021. However, with current inoculation backlogs, this could, unfortunately, be pushed back a bit further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once these groups have all received the COVID-19 vaccine, it would be time to transition into stage 2: everyone else. Individuals who are not included in the priority groups mentioned in stage 1 would be included here, and this comprises most of the U.S. population. Though vaccinations do provide immense protection from suffering disastrous COVID-19 effects, masks and other protective measures will still be mandated in public places, assuring that individuals are treated as safely as possible. 2021’s holiday season will likely entail the beginnings of society’s return to normalcy, as experts predict that most families can finally come together in joy and relief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;This image shows the difference between an adult and a teenage brain.
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.elegantbrain.com/edu4/classes/readings/depository/TNS_560/brain/teenage_brain.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;(Elegant Brain)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Adolescence is a phase of development marked by suboptimal decisions and behaviors. It’s associated with an increased rate of accidental injury, aggression, drug abuse, unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. At times, it seems that teenagers do not think things through or thoroughly understand the implications of their actions. They differ from adults in the way they act, address conflicts and make choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are over 13,000 youth deaths in the United States per year, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16760893/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the National Center for Health Statistics&lt;/a&gt;. Around 70% of these deaths are caused by motor vehicle collisions, accidental injury, murder and suicide. Results from &lt;a href=&quot;https://nam.edu/tracking-adolescent-health-behaviors-and-outcomes-strengths-and-weaknesses-of-the-youth-risk-behavior-surveillance-system/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the National Youth Risk Behavior Survey&lt;/a&gt; (YRBS) show that adolescents engage in behaviors that increase their chance of death or illness by driving after drinking, driving without a seat belt, using illegal substances, carrying weapons and/or engaging in unprotected sex that leads to unintended pregnancies and STDs, including HIV infections. The importance of recognizing risky decisions and actions in teenagers is underlined by these figures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why do adolescents act without caution?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A biological explanation for this disparity is available. Studies have shown that during childhood and adolescence and well into early adulthood, brains continue to mature and develop. When they’re very young, children’s brains have a huge growth spurt. By the time they’re six, about 90 to 95% of the adult size is already in their minds. But before it can function as an adult brain, the brain also needs a lot of remodeling. Even though the brains of all teenagers evolve roughly at the same time, there are still variations between individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The relationship between genetics and the environment (nature and nurture) parallels the growth and development of the brain, as the latter is modeled on the features of the various developmental phases of human development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key change is that unused connections are ‘pruned’ away in the thought and processing section of the brain called the grey matter. White matter is a large, intertwining neural link system that joins all four brain lobes (frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital) and the limbic system’s emotional center of the brain. Other relations are improved at the same time. Based on the ‘use it or lose it’ concept, this is the brain’s way of being more successful. This phase of pruning begins in the back of the brain. The anterior portion, the prefrontal cortex, is remodeled last.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogs/2021/january/adolescentBrainTwo.png&quot; width=&quot;60%&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin: 0 auto&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;This diagram identifies both grey and white matter. &lt;a href=&quot;https://ib.bioninja.com.au/options/option-a-neurobiology-and/a2-the-human-brain/brain-matter.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;(BioNinja)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A particular area of the brain called the amygdala has been identified by scientists to be responsible for immediate responses, including fear and violent behavior. This develops first. Since the prefrontal cortex is still maturing, adolescents rely more on the amygdala to solve problems than adults do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prefrontal cortex is the brain’s decision-making organ, responsible for the ability to prepare and think about the effects of actions, solve problems and control impulses. Changes continue into early adulthood in this section. The prefrontal cortex keeps on developing until the age of 25.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Other brain changes during puberty involve a rapid increase in brain cell connections and making brain pathways more functional. Myelin, an insulating layer that lets cells communicate, is produced by nerve cells. For the production of organized thinking and actions, all these changes are necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To further confuse matters for the teenage brain, not all sections develop on the same schedule, and schedules differ between individuals as well. The first sections to mature are primitive functions, such as motion and sensory processing (with boys maturing faster than girls in these areas). What we think of as ‘greater’ roles are on a much slower maturation timeline, such as impulse management, long-term planning, cognitive control and risk evaluation (with girls maturing faster than boys in these areas).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;How Teenagers React to Emotions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The adolescent brain is somewhat different from that of an infant or adult when it comes to coping with emotion. For the very first time, the teenage brain experiences complex emotions (enhanced or damaged by hormones, depending on context); not only do teenagers lack the adult’s life experiences to control complex emotions, but the areas of the brain that manage one’s emotions are not yet completely formed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When faced with intense or complicated feelings, teenagers are met with a double-whammy; they don’t know how to wield them, and even if they did, they wouldn’t have the brain systems in place to pull it off, as an adult brain might.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Crucial Role of Parents and Peers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the brain’s developmental stages, parents and peers play a vital role. The constantly accessed parts of the brain are improved, while the parts not used are pruned away. The teen brain is on a quest to build up what is needed and get rid of what isn’t, which is why a decline in grey matter in the early twenties is the final stage of brain maturation. With a good dollop of love, affection and support, bonds are formed and enhanced by repetitive exposure to new physical abilities, mental abilities and life experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These variations in the brain do not mean that young people are unable to make good choices or distinguish between right and wrong. That also doesn’t mean that teenagers should not be held accountable for their actions. A knowledge of these disparities, however, will assist parents, teachers, advocates and policymakers to consider and healthily support adolescent behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In September 1969, a meteorite fell near the town of Murchison in Victoria, Australia. Weighing 100 kilograms, this massive rock was initially overlooked as an ordinary meteorite. However, scientists have recently discovered that it contains the oldest material on Earth: 7-billion-year-old stardust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dust is composed of presolar grains, which are microscopic dust particles older than our sun. Though the primary molecule found in the grains was silicon carbide, the traces of neon-21 that were also found played a key role in unveiling the age of the dust. Neon-21 is produced when silicon carbide is struck by galactic cosmic rays. These rays are high-energy protons and nuclei that move through space at extremely high speeds. They can be produced by the sun, outside the solar system and even in other galaxies. The larger the neon-21 concentration in the grains, the more time that has passed since it was created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/117/4/1884&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/a&gt; (PNAS) outlines the importance of the interstellar dust: “[interstellar dust] carries a large fraction of the elements heavier than He, including the elements that form terrestrial planets and are essential for life.” Its potential to reveal the habitability of planetary systems makes interstellar dust highly valuable to researchers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the PNAS highlights the methods used to analyze the dust found within the Murchison meteorite. Astronomical spectroscopic observations (based on measuring the spectrum of electromagnetic radiation) are used to determine the composition, structure and size of the dust particles, while a variety of theoretical models are used to find the dust’s lifespan. In this particular instance, scientists approached the challenge by finding the interstellar lifetimes of individual presolar silicon carbide grains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No presolar grains have ever been discovered in rocks on Earth, making the grains on the meteorite very valuable to researchers. As explained by scientist Philipp Heck, the reason for this can be found in Earth’s geological processes: volcanism and plate tectonics transform any presolar dust that may have been left during Earth’s formation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To better understand the nature of the stardust, the team measured the size of the grains. The majority of presolar grains are one micron long. In contrast, those found on the meteorite ranged from 2 to 30 microns. Their astounding size led the team to call them ‘boulders.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Heck and his colleagues analyzed 40 of the boulders by first grinding pieces of the meteorite and then using acid to dissolve the minerals and silicate. This ultimately allowed them to determine which of the grains were acid-resistant. As outlined by the PNAS, “These grains are identified as presolar by their large isotopic anomalies that exclude an origin in the solar system.” The majority of presolar grains are destroyed during thermal metamorphosis and aqueous altercation, processes stimulating their growth in the parent bodies they come from. Hence, they are among the most ancient materials in the solar system and are of great value to scientists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the grains have been isolated, mass spectrometry, a technique used for measuring the mass to charge ratio of ions, is utilized to determine the number of nuclides produced by the grains during reactions with galactic cosmic rays. Nuclides are a specific type of atom or nucleus characterized by the number of protons and neutrons they contain. When they come into contact with high-energy particles, some of them break apart and those that are left accumulate in the presolar grains. The nuclide concentration is proportional to the timespan the grains were exposed to radiation, revealing various properties that indicate how old the dust is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These techniques ultimately revealed that the grains date to before the formation of our solar system. According to Heck, the grains “formed in an episode of enhanced star formation. There was a time before the start of the solar system when more stars formed than normal.” To clarify, the grains allow scientists to better understand stellar evolution, the ways in which stars change with time, particularly with regards to bursts of star formation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another unusual finding was that the stardust particles appeared to be stuck together. This phenomenon can be explained by the dust’s electrical charge. As explained by &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2000/ast31jul_2m&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt;, “Gravity pulls dust and gas in interstellar clouds together, but because the electrostatic force over short distances is so much stronger than gravity, even a small electrostatic repulsion between dust grains can influence (and possibly prevent) a cloud’s collapse.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the Murchison meteorite was discovered in 1969, no one could have imagined the remarkable material it kept hidden. At first glance, it would appear to be an ordinary meteorite. But as revealed by Philippe Heck and his colleagues, the stardust it contains, which is invisible to the naked eye, provides clues to the origins of stars and the history of the solar system. Though the exact age of the dust is unclear, its significance to astronomical research is evident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;Oxytocin is commonly referred to as the ‘love hormone’ because it is released when we engage in activities that stimulate attraction. This image presents the molecular structure of oxytocin. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ambiopharm.com/articles/in-honor-of-valentines-day-we-introduce-the-celebritide-oxytocin-also-known-as-the-love-hormone/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;(AmbioPharm)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The sky is painted a dark blue with small specks of light barely visible within it. The soft drops of rain cascade onto you. They stand a foot from you, looking at you in such a way that it makes your heart race and palms sweat. Suddenly, all rationality is gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can’t help but think, “Why do I have these butterflies in my stomach?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although literature and films provide an understanding of the concept of love that we all wonder about, it can also be described from a scientific point of view. The reason for the sleepless nights and endless conversations can be explained by multiple different hormones and neurochemicals that cause the joyous feeling known as love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2017/love-actually-science-behind-lust-attraction-companionship/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Harvard University&lt;/a&gt;, a study at Rutgers led by Helen Fisher indicates that there are three categories that define romantic love. These categories - lust, attraction and attachment - all contain their own set of hormones that act on us when we experience the giddy feeling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lust&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Lust is defined as an intense desire for something and is the basis for all organisms’ need to reproduce. There are two main hormones that are produced by the hypothalamus of the brain: testosterone and estrogen. These are also referred to as the ‘male’ and ‘female’ hormones, though they are prominent in both genders. The stimulation and production of these hormones are what drive procreation within humans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Attraction&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The attraction stage is more commonly associated with the feeling of butterflies and fear of rejection. Romantic passion is the more distinct phase we come across that we question or deny once we have fallen head over heels. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://asdn.net/asdn/chemistry/chemistry_of_love.php#ref&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Atomic Scale Design Network&lt;/a&gt; (ASDN) states during the first attraction, we deal with the neurochemicals that oversee our neural activity: norepinephrine, dopamine and phenylethylamine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Love can possibly even be addictive. Similarly to lust, the prefrontal cortex, which is the region of the brain that regulates rational behavior, shuts off during attraction. These regions that light up during attraction are the same that signal addiction to materialistic items or drugs such as cocaine. This may be why attraction to another person can be described as an addiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The brain pathways that control the reward behavior are involved in attraction. The reward pathways in the brain contain dopaminergic neurons that tell us whether something is aversive or rewarding. During attraction, neurons release dopamine, or the feel-good chemical, which makes our brain correlate happiness to the person and ensures the desire to see them more. When we are participating in activities that feel good to us, such as bonding or spending time with our friends, dopamine is released. With attraction, high levels of dopamine are responsible for the beginning of a relationship to have that exhilarating feeling, hence why the ‘honeymoon’ or ‘cupcake’ phase of a relationship can occur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dopamine affects the parts of the brain that control emotional response, as well as pain. It is found to be both a precursor for norepinephrine and a neurotransmitter. A precursor goes through chemical reactions to produce another chemical. Norepinephrine is another chemical involved in attraction and it cannot be produced without dopamine. In order for the effects of norepinephrine to occur, which include sweating, increased heart rate and adrenaline, there must first be enough dopamine produced. Neurotransmitters are what send chemical messages throughout the body to specific cells to perform a function. Our bodies contain a dopamine neurotransmitter system allowing us to feel good by the activation of the dopamine receptors that collaborate with our brain’s pleasure system. This gives us the motivation to continue to do activities that produce dopamine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dopamine does not act alone in the beginnings of romantic attraction; there is also norepinephrine. The reason we get sweaty palms when we are with someone we are infatuated with is the result of the neurochemical norepinephrine, or noradrenaline, which plays a role in the fight or flight response. This neurochemical is what stimulates the production of adrenaline. The norepinephrine system acts as the body’s chemical messengers and, when activated, does a variety of actions to specific cell types. This system increases our experience of joy, reduces appetite and also involves cortisol maintenance and initiation. In other words, it is responsible for sustaining the stress hormone, cortisol. According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reagent.co.uk/the-chemistry-of-love/#:~:text=The%20initial%20spark%20of%20falling,pleasure%2C%20energy%20and%20focussed%20attention&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ReAgent&lt;/a&gt;, Richard Schwartz claims that when you are in love, your levels of cortisol are raised, thus suppressing immune function. Maybe love does make us a little sick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where cortisol is increased, serotonin is also decreased. Serotonin, a neurotransmitter related to our feelings of happiness, is what affects our body’s functions of mood, memory, sleep and appetite. Communication is disrupted by lower levels of serotonin and causes anxiety, compulsiveness and obsessiveness. This is often why when people are infatuated, they feel that person is all-consuming of their thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the last major neurochemical that is involved with attraction is phenylethylamine (PEA). PEA is what releases norepinephrine and dopamine, and is what makes our tummies do somersaults at the antics of our significant other. The more PEA that is produced, the more dopamine is released. PEA is a neuromodulator compared to the other two neurochemicals; it modulates the initiation of the norepinephrine system and increases the levels of dopamine. Though it is not proven, it is assumed that PEA resides in the presynaptic vesicles and takes dopamine’s usual spot, leading to an increase in circulating dopamine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe love at first sight is slightly overrated, but there’s definitely chemistry when two people first start out in a relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Attachment&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;After couples have gone through the honeymoon phase and it feels like the spark has died out, the final stage of love sets in. Attachment is the indicator of long-lasting relationships and is not only limited to romantic affiliations, unlike lust and attraction. Though the butterflies are gone, that does not mean the chemistry is gone. The release of dopamine and norepinephrine is exchanged with oxytocin and vasopressin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As attachment occurs, the ‘puppy love’ act lessens and the neurotransmitter oxytocin increases. Through this, a calmer, more mature form of love is presented with concrete bonds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long term relations also include family and friends, forming the emotional bond between people and partners. Oxytocin which is commonly referred to as the ‘cuddle hormone’ or the ‘love hormone’ is produced in the hypothalamus of the brain like dopamine. This hormone deals with the emotional and cognitive behaviors of a person and is prominent in adapting to emotional situations. It’s produced in high quantities when participating in activities that encourage bonding and reducing stress response and anxiety. However, it can also stimulate jealousy and irrationality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vasopressin partners with oxytocin within long term relationships to establish closeness and bondage. From these two, there is a disruption of the dopamine and norepinephrine pathways, causing passion to fall and attachment to grow. These hormones help raise health benefits for married couples and decrease depression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these hormones provide the development of relationships with others, it can be the downfall of them as well. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2442436/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;National Library of Medicine&lt;/a&gt; stated that studying drugs MDMA (Molly or Ecstasy) and GHB (Liquid Ecstasy) assumed that oxytocin may be the reason for the ‘high’ that is produced. It is shown that an overabundance of oxytocin can cause dissociation and reckless behavior. While oxytocin and dopamine may benefit our attraction towards people, a surplus of it can cause an unhealthy emotional dependence and irrational behavior similar to when one is addicted to binge eating and substance abuse. Only at stable doses can these hormones cause the warm, bubbly feeling we know when we fall in love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like any science, there is more complexity than what we can really pinpoint. There is a limited amount of what science can explain about the chemistry between people. Whether or not it’s hormones that allow us to find our soulmate rather than fate, or if it really comes from the head instead of the heart, we can’t blame high school teenagers for thinking they have met their matches when we are all dealing with the same hormones and chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Give oxytocin some love for matchmaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;This illustration shows the different ways someone might develop social anxiety disorder.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.verywellmind.com/social-anxiety-disorder-causes-3024749&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;(Brianna Gilmartin / Verywell)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Many people are shy when it comes to social situations. They might feel hesitant to meet new people and feel overwhelmed by social gatherings such as parties. These feelings are completely normal, but they can reach a point of severity where they are not. Some people feel terrified of the mere idea of meeting new people, and they might completely avoid social gatherings as a result. These people likely have what is known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://childmind.org/article/what-is-social-anxiety/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;social anxiety disorder&lt;/a&gt; (SAD), which they can either be born with or develop over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes referred to as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.healthline.com/health/anxiety/social-phobia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;social phobia&lt;/a&gt;, SAD causes a plethora of irrational feelings for whoever suffers from it. People with the disorder realize a lot of their feelings are hyperbolic, but sometimes, they may feel powerless to do anything about how it influences their cognition towards the world. Although it was compared to shyness previously, SAD is far more damaging. It can seriously deteriorate someone’s relationship with themself, their family, friends, work and school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With SAD &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mhanational.org/conditions/social-anxiety-disorder&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;impacting 7% of Americans (15 million of the overall population)&lt;/a&gt;, a large number of people’s lives are negatively impacted due to the disorder. The high percentage indicates this is one of the most common mental disorders in America. With such prevalence, it is important to know some of the symptoms of SAD. This can help you assist someone who may have it, or even yourself. Some symptoms include &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.healthline.com/health/anxiety/social-phobia#symptoms&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;trembling or shaking, rapid heart rate and dizziness&lt;/a&gt;. Those are just physical symptoms— some psychological ones include worrying deeply about social situations, concerning yourself with upcoming social activities days or weeks before they even occur and potentially using drugs to calm down any fear related to social contexts. These symptoms only become worse with the assumptions that the disorder gives you: that everyone notices everything you do and silently judges you at every chance they get. This can cause an unrelenting feeling of exhaustion for the person with SAD, so getting the proper support is in that person’s best interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogs/2021/january/socialAnxietyTwo.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;70%&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin: 0 auto&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;This illustrates something common that a lot of people with SAD experience: the feeling that everyone around you is focused on you in negative ways.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://stayprepared.sg/mymentalhealth/articles/social-anxiety-and-the-new-normal/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;(My Mental Health)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Such a detrimental mental health disorder can develop in a variety of ways, all of which are shown in the illustration at the top of the article. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.verywellmind.com/social-anxiety-disorder-causes-3024749&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The most common way to develop the disorder&lt;/a&gt; is by simply being born with it. If they are born with a specific set of genes, they may be more prone to SAD, especially if they have a relative with it. This also ties into the way the person’s brain is structured and how their neurotransmitters are balanced. A second way to get it is largely dependent on a variety of social situations. Did people make fun of you today? Do they constantly keep making fun of you? Does this get to you on an extremely personal level, so much so you evaluate your entire self-worth? If a person answers yes to these questions, as well as any other questions of that nature, there is a chance they have the disorder and should continue looking into these feelings. A third way to become socially anxious depends on your upbringing. If a person has extremely strict parents who strongly limit their opportunities to have social interactions or be in social situations, their experience when it comes to these two areas will be largely stilted, which may manifest into SAD when the person grows older.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How would a person go about getting the proper support? There is a multitude of ways, with one being a prescription medication. A wide variety of drugs can help lessen the impact SAD, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.verywellmind.com/treatments-for-social-anxiety-disorder-3024949&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;but all medications have side effects&lt;/a&gt;, so the medication someone decides to use is largely dependent on the specific individual. Some examples of these drugs are Zoloft, Prozac, Cymbalta, Marplan, Tenormin and Valium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other ways to lessen the impact of SAD include psychotherapy, such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). This common treatment focuses on influencing your behaviors and thoughts in a positive way to stop negative emotions by using techniques, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.verywellmind.com/treatments-for-social-anxiety-disorder-3024949&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;exposure, cognitive restructuring and social skills training&lt;/a&gt;. The first technique allows the person to practice being in social situations, the second involves evaluation of existing negative thoughts and the third deals with the improvement of several soft skills needed for a variety of social situations. The third technique is similar to the first but focuses on what a person would do rather than having them act on the spot. Social skills training is usually reserved for extreme cases of the disorder, so most people can be treated with just the first two techniques. There are other ways to counteract the impact of SAD, but these three techniques are the most well-known.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though it may seem difficult for a person to beat social anxiety, it is important to consistently receive treatment or support. The aforementioned treatment options &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.healthline.com/health/anxiety/social-phobia#outlook&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;have been proven to help lessen the control the disorder has on your life&lt;/a&gt;, and the positive outlook gained from undergoing one of the treatment options will only cause a ripple effect that is sure to expand into a higher self-esteem. As someone who had SAD myself and went to therapy for it, I can tell you that CBT has been of great help. If you have social anxiety or suspect that you may, I highly recommend that you look into receiving CBT and going from there. Social anxiety is strong, but you are stronger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;A toddler cries in distress.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.parent4success.com/2012/02/16/25-ways-to-calm-a-crying-baby/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;(Parent 4 Success)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We usually associate crying with those who are vulnerable or those who are too helpless to help themselves. Babies and small children, who are notorious for bursting straight into tears whenever they are presented with any sort of upsetting situation, usually come to mind. But this is understandable—they cry to communicate since their limited capacity of language falls short. However, even when you’ve grown well past that age and you’re expected to solve your problems with words and actions instead of sitting and weeping about them, you might still find yourself sitting and weeping every now and then. The question today is why shedding tears is our bodies’ natural response to various events in our lives. What exactly makes human beings cry?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://time.com/4254089/science-crying/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Jonathan Rottenberg&lt;/a&gt;, an emotion researcher and psychology professor at the University of South Florida, “crying signals to yourself and other people that there’s some important problem that is at least temporarily beyond your ability to cope.” Interestingly enough, there are many different tear-inducing problems you can face, and they will give rise to varying kinds of tears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we have reflex tears, which are tears unrelated to emotion and induced when your body senses something is wrong in the environment. The lacrimal gland, located between the eyeball and the eyelid, will produce reflex tears to protect your eyes from threatening air particles like dust, smoke or most infamously: the stinging fumes of an onion. When you blink, the teardrop spreads across the surface of your eye and accumulates into a pool, which is when your eyes well up. Once too much liquid collects together, the pool overflows and sends tears trickling down your face, thereby washing out any irritants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, we have psychic tears. These are the kind caused by a surge of strong emotion, which could range anywhere from pure joy to utter devastation. You could shed psychic tears because you’re feeling stressed beyond comparison, because you’re overwhelmed with nostalgia, or even because your friend’s jokes are just way too hilarious. The reason why all of these unrelated situations produce the same tearful outcome is due to the work of a neurotransmitter called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/why-do-we-cry-the-science-of-tears-9741287.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;acetylcholine&lt;/a&gt;. Acetylcholine links the autonomic nervous system, which is the neural system that you can’t control, to the lacrimal tear system. When your body undergoes a particularly emotional response to any kind of stimulus, your nervous system will release acetylcholine, which will then move to trigger tear production in the lacrimal apparatus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The noteworthy part of this process is the uncontrollability of its origin. Most people cry when they lose control over their emotions, when their bodies take over and react for them. This can often be because they encounter something that is out of their realm of control in the first place, and all they can do is succumb to an emotional response. But that begs the question, why crying as an emotional response? What will crying attain for us that no other bodily function can?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer brings us back to the very beginning of our discussion: crying for help. Regardless of whether you are a small child or a grown person, weeping makes you look vulnerable. Those watery eyes, woeful sniffles and dampened cheeks—all signs point to a guard that has fallen, which can in turn cast a very strong emotional effect on surrounding people. Most individuals tend to feel more sorry for those who are visibly crying, and as a result, they are more inclined to help those people. This idea is supported by a &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/147470491301100114#:~:text=The%20even%20faster%20recognition%20of,be%20investigated%20in%20the%20future&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2013 study&lt;/a&gt; held by Tilburg University in which participants were shown photographs of people with sad and neutral expressions with and without tears. In both rounds of the study, the participants showcased a higher perceived need for social support amid the people depicted with tears. This study indicates that tears do serve as a prominent visual cue for sadness and the need for outside care, and they help promote person-to-person connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not to mention, scientists have found &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1542012412701842&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;higher protein content&lt;/a&gt; in psychic tears than in reflex tears, which causes them to be thicker and stickier. This makes it more likely for people to notice them as they run slowly down your face, helping you procure any emotional support or comfort that you need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among these greater levels of proteins reside adrenocorticotropic hormones, which are associated with increased stress levels. Some scientists deduce that people cry to purge these stress-associated chemicals from their bodies and restore their bodies to an emotional balance. And although studies heretofore have not been fully conclusive, it’s widely accepted that turning on the waterworks can be a truly cathartic experience. You get to release all those bottled-up feelings through your tears, and it could feel like letting out one big sigh of relief. It’s also noteworthy that when you cry in response to physical pain, like stubbing your toe or getting a papercut, your body will release &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.healthline.com/health/why-do-we-cry#relieving-pain&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;endorphins and oxytocin&lt;/a&gt;, which are feel-good natural chemicals that can help placate your discomfort and improve your mood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The takeaway from all of this is that we cry to make ourselves feel better. This improved condition can be achieved through supportive interpersonal connection or through the act of crying itself as an inherently self-soothing procedure. Even though we cannot control how it begins, we can control what we get out of it, and that is healing.&lt;/p&gt;
