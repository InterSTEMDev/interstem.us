&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;Groundbreaking research shows humans’ innate desire for connections with others is surprisingly similar to hunger cravings.  
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.uri.edu/features/neuroscience/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;(The University of Rhode Island)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Just as hungry brains crave food, lonely brains crave people, new research suggests. This interesting connection between the two types of deprivation is increasingly important as COVID-19 isolates us all, demonstrating how social distancing can have detrimental effects on our lonely brains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Livia Tomova and her team at MIT created an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-020-00742-z&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;experiment&lt;/a&gt; to test the cognitive response to cravings. Participants volunteered to go without food for 10 hours so Tomova could determine which nerve cells responded to the need for food. Certain neurotransmitters became excited at the sight of junk food, and the neurons subsequently released dopamine as a positive reaction. This happy chemical is released frequently as a type of reward for the human brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on this initial segment of the experiment, Tomova wanted to test exactly how the brain responds to social deprivation, and how it differed from food deprivation. The same subjects were placed in a room entirely alone for 10 hours. After the isolation time ended, Tomova exposed the subjects to pictures of people and social gatherings. The subjects’ brains were immediately activated and produced dopamine, the same chemical that indicates a reward. In other words, they responded almost identically to the need for food as to the need for human contacts, indicating a fundamental connection between the two necessities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some subjects, the loneliness was more difficult, and this was reflected in their neural response to the hours of isolation. Others reported that the experience was not nearly as challenging for them, as it reflected their daily lifestyle. Therefore, environmental impacts such as general isolation or loneliness throughout life can make a human brain more accustomed to the feeling, thus not feeling much of a reward when exposed to social situations. Similarly, people tolerate hunger differently, since some generally have a greater tolerance for pain, which can come from a lack of food. They may feel the hunger on varying degrees, in the same way they experience loneliness, so people should remember that everyone’s circumstances in COVID-19 are inconsistent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A thought to keep in mind, however, is that those who have stronger wills to combat suffering may still be in pain, although it may not be obvious to others. During COVID-19, all people should still receive empathy for the loneliness they may be feeling, since they can still be hurting at the same degree as those that express their feelings more. It is important to remember that a coping mechanism for many is to push their struggles deep inside and ignore that something is missing in their lives, which may give others the illusion that they are unaffected by these times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The physiological connection between the need for food and social interactions demonstrates how humans’ brains react similarly when we are deprived of certain needs that our bodies require. Tomova’s experiment reflects how people’s brains are different from those of other individuals and therefore have varying responses to isolation. But overall, the deprivation of social connections can have an adverse effect on the brain as dopamine is an essential chemical to positive mental health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tomova stressed the importance of being understanding in our current time, as isolation can put mental and physical health at stake, so everyone should respect the situations of others, as isolation impacts everyone in various ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Introduction&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an anxiety disorder that develops after a traumatic experience. A certain trigger after the incident may cause a person to recall the horrifying event, which in turn may cause them to become distant with those they once were close to. Everything from a mugging, threats, scarring incidents, robbery, and natural catastrophes can be a traumatic experience. Depression and drug misuse also exacerbate the condition. Different individuals encounter novel experiences that are more traumatic than others. This makes it difficult to precisely determine what particular event is traumatic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the period from just after the traumatic incident to six months later, acute stress disorder occurs. PTSD begins at the six-month mark and persists thereafter. However, not all trauma patients develop PTSD immediately following exposure. Some individuals respond rapidly to traumatic exposure, while others remain unscathed only to experience the sudden onset of PTSD symptoms months or years later. Flashbacks, extreme anxiety and uncontrollable thoughts about the incident can all be symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;PTSD Amongst Veterans&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have seen a dramatic rise in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25077185/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;number of Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans&lt;/a&gt; seeking help for PTSD over the past few years, shining a spotlight on this chronic condition and posing crucial questions about adequate treatment services and care barriers. At any given point, the disorder affects millions: about 8% of individuals in the United States will experience it at some point in their lives. Military veterans are extremely vulnerable: 20% of those who served in Iraq and Afghanistan returned home with PTSD or depression. And since the year 2000, over 350,000 service members have been diagnosed with traumatic brain injury, many of whom have cognitive or behavioral disabilities. The alarming suicide rate among veterans is a testament to psychic wounds that linger long after the war ends: 20 end their lives every day.

&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Impacts of Mental Trauma on Memory and the Brain&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abuse of children and other causes of severe stress may have permanent effects on the areas of the brain involved in memory and emotion. In particular, the hippocampus appears to be very stress-sensitive. Not only will stress damage to the hippocampus cause difficulty in coping with memories and other consequences of prior traumatic events, but it can also hinder new learning. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK3874/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; has shown that as part of its regular function, the hippocampus can regenerate nerve cells, but stress impairs the process by preventing or slowing down the regeneration of neurons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogs/2020/december/ptsdThree.png&quot; width=&quot;40%&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin: 0 auto&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;The hippocampus (in blue) is shown within the context of the brain.

&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/253494116_The_Invisible_Epidemic_Post-Traumatic_Stress_Disorder_Memory_and_the_Brain&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;A study&lt;/a&gt; was carried out to see whether the symptoms of PTSD matched the observable loss of neurons in the hippocampus. Vietnam war veterans with declaratory memory issues caused by PTSD were first tested. These war veterans were found to have an 8% decrease in right hippocampal volume, assessed with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and brain imaging. However, there were no changes in other areas of the brain.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogs/2020/december/ptsdFour.png&quot; width=&quot;40%&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin: 0 auto&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;The MRI scans are of the Vietnam war veterans who have declaratory memory issues.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/253494116_The_Invisible_Epidemic_Post-Traumatic_Stress_Disorder_Memory_and_the_Brain&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;(Research gate)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study found that reduced right hippocampal volume was associated with short-term memory loss in patients with PTSD. When looking at PTSD patients who were victims of physical or sexual assault during their childhood, similar findings were observed. According to more recent studies that have reported hippocampal volume reduction in PTSD, these studies also indicate that the reduction in hippocampal volume is unique to PTSD and is not correlated with conditions such as anxiety or panic disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Damage to the hippocampus, following exposure to the strain brought on by childhood abuse, results in distortion and fragmentation of memories. In linking and arranging various aspects of memory, the hippocampus plays an important role and is assumed to be responsible for locating the memory of an occurrence in its proper time, place and context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if a person was a victim of childhood abuse due to alcohol and was locked away in a closet of old clothes, he or she may only remember the smell of alcohol or that of the old clothes, but not the part about having been locked in the closet. He or she may experience a sudden flashback or have a panic attack when the smell of alcohol hits them. Psychotherapy (talk therapy) or an experience that causes similar feelings will help the patient rebuild memories in these situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another significant area is the amygdala, a region of the brain involved in associative learning, value encoding and emotional responses. PTSD symptom intensity can be independently predicted by both smaller amygdala volume and less reliable monitoring of the negative value of face stimuli (negative surprises in the environment) in the amygdala.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nimh.nih.gov/news/science-news/2019/brain-biomarkers-could-help-identify-those-at-risk-of-severe-ptsd.shtml&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;A study&lt;/a&gt; conducted by Daniela Schiller, Ph.D. and Ilan Harpaz-Rotem, Ph.D. on combat veterans offered the conclusion that the severity of PTSD symptoms is mirrored in how combat veterans react to negative external shocks when the anticipated results are not as planned, and how the way the brain is tuned to these stimuli is different.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogs/2020/december/ptsdFive.png&quot; width=&quot;20%&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin: 0 auto&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;The regions of interest (functionally defined amygdala) used in the study of computational imaging are shown in red.

&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Variations between those with or without PTSD were also shown in other brain regions involved that are related to danger learning, such as the striatum (a part that coordinates multiple aspects of cognition) and the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (a brain region that subserves cognition and motor control).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Treatments&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To minimize symptoms and improve function, having appropriate care after the development of PTSD symptoms may be crucial. The ideal PTSD treatment, which is secure, safe, fast-acting and has minimal side effects, has been elusive. And, as with many mental health conditions, patients often have difficulty embracing or adhering to any of the available solutions. For years, the military department and healthcare experts have sought a range of options for effective treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rti.org/impact/stellate-ganglion-block-new-treatment-ptsd#:~:text=SGB%20is%20a%20true%20breakthrough,a%20deterrent%20to%20seeking%20treatment&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;One of the recent procedures&lt;/a&gt; is the stellate ganglion block (SGB) procedure, which was discovered to be effective in the fall of 2019. The operation involves injecting the stellate ganglion with a local anesthetic. This community of neck nerve cells helps control the “fight or flight” function of the body. Some military medical facilities started offering this treatment to PTSD patients in the early 2010s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the SGB procedure was studied by more researchers and patients, the results appeared positive. But the proof of its efficacy was still required by the medical community. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rti.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;RTI International&lt;/a&gt;, a nonprofit research institution, launched a randomized, controlled SGB trial in 2014, and gave an official report by the end of 2019. A suggested reason for the sustained efficacy of SGB on PTSD, as well as the effects of hot flashes and complex regional pain syndrome, is that local anesthetic application to the stellate ganglion contributes to a decrease in the growth factor of the nerve and subsequently, a decrease in the amount of sympathetic nerve sprouting and norepinephrine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogs/2020/december/ptsdSix.png&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin: 0 auto&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;The diagram above illustrates the stellate ganglion.
(Anatomy of the Human Body)
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Psychotherapy and drugs that are short- and long-term will also treat PTSD well. Sometimes, the two types of treatment are more successful together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another way of treating PTSD is by using &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_processing_therapy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT)&lt;/a&gt;. It is a particular method of cognitive-behavioral therapy that has been effective in minimizing PTSD symptoms. Over 12 hours, CPT is administered; the process helps patients learn how to question and change harmful trauma-related assumptions. In doing so, the patient develops a new perception and conceptualization of the traumatic incident so that its ongoing detrimental effects on current life are minimized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exposure to a traumatic stimulus is another method of intervention widely used to help people confront fears in cognitive-behavioral therapy. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apa.org/ptsd-guideline/treatments/prolonged-exposure&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Prolonged exposure (PE)&lt;/a&gt; is a special form of cognitive-behavioral therapy that helps people gradually handle memories, emotions and circumstances relevant to their trauma. Most individuals try to stop something that reminds them of the trauma they have endured, but their anxiety is intensified by doing so. An individual may minimize PTSD symptoms by consciously learning that the memories and signs related to trauma are not dangerous and do not need to be prevented by confronting what has been avoided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concerning physical treatment, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-6969-9095/paroxetine-oral/paroxetine-oral/details&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;paroxetine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-1/sertraline-oral/details&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;sertraline&lt;/a&gt; are the only drugs to have been approved by the FDA for treating PTSD. Since different people react to drugs differently, and not everyone’s PTSD is the same, the doctor can also prescribe other “off label” medicines, meaning that the manufacturers of those medicines have not requested the FDA to review drug trials proving the drug is specifically effective for PTSD. These may include &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.webmd.com/depression/guide/depression-medications-antidepressants&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;antidepressants&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoamine_oxidase_inhibitor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;monoamine oxidase inhibitors&lt;/a&gt; (MAOIs), &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK519503/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;antipsychotics or second-generation antipsychotics&lt;/a&gt; (SGAs), &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/173068&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;beta-blockers&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medicinenet.com/benzodiazepines_sleep-inducing-oral/article.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;benzodiazepines&lt;/a&gt;. Medications do not remove the symptoms, but they may make them more manageable by decreasing their severity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The National PTSD Center provides self-help resources, including the PTSD Coach Online app and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://mobile.va.gov/app/ptsd-coach&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PTSD Coach app&lt;/a&gt;. These provide therapy to deal with depression, anxiety and other symptoms that can be formed by people who have been through trauma. When PTSD patients feel depressed, the apps can help them relax, boost their mood, teach them how to solve tough issues and help change their thought patterns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Taking Action&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An individual who is subjected to a traumatic event may feel powerless, causing a concerned partner to take action to assist them. Perhaps the most effective approach is being there for the person, showing acceptance and concern, and listening without being judgmental or providing advice. It is necessary to promote healthy living, such as adherence to the diet, exercise and refraining from smoking and excessive alcohol use. Arranging fun recreational activities is another way to help those with PTSD live a happier and more relaxed life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogs/2020/december/keystoneSpeciesOne.png&quot; width=&quot;70%&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin: 0 auto&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;A mother grey wolf and her cubs in present-day Yellowstone National Park. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nrdc.org/issues/protect-keystone-species&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;(James Michael Kruger / iStock)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The year was 1924. Barren dirt replaced the characteristic native plants of Yellowstone National Park. Streams running through the plains and forests of the park eroded the land away at an alarming rate. Bird populations flew off to faraway lands, leaving their former home— now a wasteland— behind. What could be the cause of this catastrophic decline in the beloved National Park? What sparked this event that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nrdc.org/issues/protect-keystone-species&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;National Geographic&lt;/a&gt; calls a “top-down trophic cascade”? It turns out the cause of the ecological disaster was the loss of only one species: the grey wolf. The grey wolf happened to be very important because it was a keystone species.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A keystone species is any species that has a niche, or ecological job, so specific that other organisms in its environment cannot fulfill that same role. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oursafetynet.org/2020/02/07/what-are-keystone-species/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Canadian National Environmental Treasure&lt;/a&gt; notes the term as being first used by ecologist Robert T. Paine. Paine observed the relationship between ochre sea stars and their prey, mussels, and determined that a loss in the ochre sea star population would trigger an uncontrolled growth in the mussel population, which in turn would negatively affect other aspects of the environment. National Geographic notes that other well-known species that serve as keystone species in their environment include grey wolves, salmon and elephants. Keystone species can be found at every level of the food pyramid, from producer to apex predator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, the grey wolf was the only predator of elk. Without the wolves, the elk population exploded. Elk overgrazed the vegetation in Yellowstone, leaving the ground barren and the stream banks lacking the native plants that usually prevented erosion. The elk population took food away from other herbivores and omnivores, leaving them to starve. Just as a keystone keeps an arch from collapsing, the grey wolf kept Yellowstone from collapsing. When the wolves were taken away from Yellowstone, the ecosystem fell apart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keystone species may be the most important species in an ecosystem, but they are not always the most aesthetic or well-known creatures. Many people take up rallying cries to save animals considered cute, but few take up the rallying cry to save the lumpy and veined ochre sea star. Despite their adorable appearances, if some popular animals disappeared from the wild, the environmental impact would not be as extreme. Since society collectively does not understand the importance of keystone species, more and more keystone species are becoming endangered while conservation efforts focus on the most popular species. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nrdc.org/issues/protect-keystone-species&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;United States Natural Resources Defense Council&lt;/a&gt; (NRDC) also cites human development and the environmental mismanagement of governments as reasons for the decline of keystone species. The NRDC argues that listening to the advice of ecologists on the topic of conservation is the only way forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After scientists and the government alike watched the Yellowstone ecosystem collapse, they realized that something had to be done. National Geographic reports that in 1990, nearly seventy years after the top-down trophic cascade in Yellowstone began, the United States government started a program to reintroduce grey wolves to the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. Since then, the ecosystem has sprung back to life. Despite the fact that the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem was in shambles less than thirty years ago, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nationalparks.org/explore-parks/yellowstone-national-park&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;National Park Foundation&lt;/a&gt; (NPF) describes present-day Yellowstone as an “otherworldly” and “truly unique” place with “plentiful wildlife”. Visitors to the park are sometimes lucky enough to see one of the keystone species in the distance, as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nationalparks.org/our-work/programs/yellowstone-wolf-impact-study&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Yellowstone Wolf Impact Study&lt;/a&gt; from the NPF reports that the grey wolf population has grown to over 400 individuals, each one helping to hold the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem together. Almost a century later, many species that migrated from the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem have returned. Communities of animals that nearly went extinct are thriving again, their population numbers constant. Plants cover the ground again, feeding animals and holding streams in place. Thanks to the return of its keystone species, the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem is once again intact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story of the wolves illustrates the importance of protecting keystone species. If keystone species are not protected and consequently disappear from the world’s ecosystems, the world’s environment would shatter. This type of ecological disaster can be avoided if governments work with scientists to prioritize the protection of keystone species. If society begins to understand the importance of keystone species and advocates for their protection, the world can move forward, united against environmental ruin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogs/2020/december/dualFunctionOne.jpg&quot; width=&quot;60%&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin: 0 auto&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;A look inside Copenhill shows the same sleek design, created to burn huge amounts of waste and convert it to clean energy for citizens of Denmark. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.archpaper.com/2020/11/copenhill-bigs-skiable-waste-to-energy-power-plant-gets-sweeping-new-photos-from-hufton-crow/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;(The Architect’s Newspaper)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In a quickly-shrinking world where space and resources are limited, we find ourselves being forced to choose. Convenient or reusable? Cheap or clean? Beautiful or eco-friendly? However, a new group of thinkers are emerging: ones who question why we have to pick one or the other. They are combining environmentally-conscious thinking with state-of-the-art technology and engineering to create products and buildings that are multifunctional and can integrate into day-to-day life. Copenhill, the creation of Danish architect Bjarke Ingels, fits this mindset perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This building is the cleanest waste-to-energy plant in the world, Copenhagen’s tallest and largest structure, and also the home of Denmark’s first ski slope, as stated by an article about the project in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.archdaily.com/925966/copenhill-the-story-of-bigs-iconic-waste-to-energy-plant&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ArchDaily&lt;/a&gt;. Copenhill combines functionality with fun, efficiency with elegance and sustainability with sustenance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Created by Bjarke Ingels Group (BIG), the idea for Copenhill first arose in 2002, when the company, then called PLOT, imagined a public space in one of Denmark’s most dense urban areas that utilized space by placing a ski slope on top of a department store. While PLOT never saw the project through, it did inspire the concept for a waste-to-energy plant that won an international design competition in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, 170,000 square feet of ski slopes and parks that comprise Copenhill’s roof neatly cover the plant. According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.power-technology.com/projects/amager-bakke-waste-energy-plant/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Power Technology&lt;/a&gt;, the roof itself was designed by Stig L. Andersson Landscape Architects, a Danish architectural lab. In addition to the slopes and parks, the public has access to a running path, a café and a forest, all atop the building. The outside covering shows off aluminum bricks (1.2 meters by 3.3 meters) all overlapping each other to create a sleek and elegant facade that doubles as a recreational rock climbing wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the exterior itself is unique and interesting, it is what is on the inside that showcases Ingel’s mind and the abilities of technology and engineering. As explained in an article by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.power-technology.com/projects/amager-bakke-waste-energy-plant/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Power Technology&lt;/a&gt;, the waste-to-energy process begins by dumping trash into a containment area, where a large crane transfers it to a hopper (a large pyramidal shaped container designed to hold loose material, which then brings it to a combustor grate). For this plant specifically, Ingel utilized DynagGrate, an advanced, water-cooled combustor grate made by the company &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.babcock.com/products/combustion-grates-stokers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Babcock and Wilcox&lt;/a&gt;. The grate is designed to agitate the fuel bed the waste sits in when it burns to increase the rate of combustion and limit wear on the mechanical parts by preventing contact between the individual grate bars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogs/2020/december/dualFunctionTwo.jpg&quot; width=&quot;30%&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin: 0 auto&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;The image above depicts a combustion grate. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.babcock.com/en/products/combustion-grates-stokers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;(Babcock and Wilcox)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
After the waste is heated, the energy it produces is used to heat up water in a boiler, which travels through a steam drum to a turbine. The steam turbine powered by water vapor produces electricity, while the hot gas itself heats homes, depicted in a diagram from &lt;a href=&quot;https://deltawayenergy.com/2018/08/waste-to-energy-how-it-works/&quot; target=&quot;_blanK&quot;&gt;Deltaway Energy&lt;/a&gt; down below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogs/2020/december/dualFunctionThree.jpg&quot; width=&quot;30%&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin: 0 auto&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://deltawayenergy.com/2018/08/waste-to-energy-how-it-works/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;(Deltaway Energy)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Copenhill uses flue gas condensation technology to recover 100 million liters of water that would otherwise exit the plant as water vapor, cool it down and filter out 100,000 liters of bottom ash (made from the combustion of the waste) to be used as road materials every year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collecting waste from 500,000 to 700,000 people and 46,000 companies in and near Copenhagen, the plant has a 107% energy efficiency, overstepping its designed goal to utilize 100% of energy content. It is also twice as efficient in producing energy than Europe’s older waste-to-energy plants, generating steam at 440°C and at a pressure of 70 bars (unit of pressure).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plant exemplifies the architectural concept of hedonistic design, which is the idea that sustainability can come without compromise. Best summed up in an article on &lt;a href=&quot;https://bigthink.com/endless-innovation/designing-a-hedonistic-and-sustainable-future&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Big Think&lt;/a&gt; by Dominic Basulto, hedonistic design asks the question, “What if you can do something that is good for the environment while doing something good for yourself and for the economy?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copenhill is a building that finally manages to satisfy everyone and everything, from the economy to the environmentalists and people young and old. Ingels, the mastermind behind the project and founder of BIG, says it is “a crystal clear example of hedonistic sustainability – that a sustainable city is not only better for the environment – it is also more enjoyable for the lives of its citizens.” Ingles is well-known as an innovator and outside-the-box thinker, as exemplified in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ted.com/talks/bjarke_ingels_hedonistic_sustainability#t-37601&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;TEDx&lt;/a&gt; talk he gave in New York City. To him, it is an example that “we have the power to give form to the future that we want to live in.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project is in line with the city of Copenhagen’s goal of becoming carbon-neutral by 2025.  Parameters for carbon neutrality are laid out by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/headlines/society/20190926STO62270/what-is-carbon-neutrality-and-how-can-it-be-achieved-by-2050&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;European Parliament&lt;/a&gt;, which explains it as “having a balance between emitting carbon and absorbing carbon from the atmosphere in carbon sinks.” A carbon sink is a system that acts as storage for carbon by absorbing more carbon than it creates; examples of this are soil, forests and oceans. Copenhagen’s carbon-neutrality goal is part of a larger climate policy put into place by the European Union, which aims to become carbon neutral by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copenhill perfectly sums up what architecture can – and will – do. Its completion signifies the beginning of a new age of architecture, where buildings move beyond simple skeletons for activities and transform into meaningful structures that work with the environment, rather than against it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogs/2020/december/roboticsOne.png&quot; width=&quot;70%&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin: 0 auto&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;Robots have already greatly benefitted countless industries, such as automation, and can potentially be applied to many more. &lt;a href=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
(Technavio)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Popular culture has long warned humankind that robots will soon take over. From Pixar movie “WALL-E” to the science-fiction book “Humans, Bow Down,” robots are seemingly within reach of reigning the world. However, in the InterSTEM Speaker Series, Professor Heiko Hoffmann debunked this fear and revealed the true state of robotics to be far from those dystopian expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although not as advanced as Hollywood’s predictions, robots are still present across the globe. According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.therobotreport.com/6-industries-demand-robotics-developers-grow-2025/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Robot Report&lt;/a&gt;, robots have been implemented into various industries, such as automation, food, agriculture, healthcare and manufacturing, as the technology can perform precisely and efficiently to pick and place motions in controlled settings. In just the third quarter of 2019, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.industryweek.com/technology-and-iiot/article/22028667/2020-future-of-manufacturing-technology&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Industry Week&lt;/a&gt; reported that orders for robots totaled over $1.3 billion, demonstrating how widespread robotics has become.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robots can vary in structure and function, but Dr. Hoffmann clarifies that most robots, especially ones in manufacturing, consist of robotic arms on a moving unit that utilizes linear grippers which open and close. For example, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/mission/facts/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;National Aeronautics and Space Administration&lt;/a&gt; (NASA) explains that their space exploration robots have linear grippers and wheels, as well as complex machinery like drills to conduct soil analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several products that seek to address the issues of current robots, such as limited flexibility and autonomy, are under development. For instance, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bostondynamics.com/atlas&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Boston Dynamics&lt;/a&gt; has designed a human-sized robot named Atlas that specializes in locomotion, such as backflips and jumping, and can move up to 1.5 meters per second. In addition, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/the-education-of-brett-the-robot/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;WIRED&lt;/a&gt; explains that the Berkley robot for the Elimination of Tedious Tasks (BRETT) employs imitation and reinforcement learning to teach itself new skills on its own, such as putting pegs into holes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But how do these robots work? According to Dr. Hoffmann, robots function using three steps. First, the robot must understand its location in a 3D and relative to the objects around it, a process which includes examining the depth of its surroundings, distinguishing the outline of objects and interpreting its scene through a computer. A robot’s perception system often includes a depth sensor, light detection and ranging (Lidar) and cameras. Second, the robot must plan several collision-free trajectories and choose the fastest or most direct option. Finally, the robot must execute movements by controlling the power and speed of the actuators and motors. A robot often has to simultaneously perform all three tasks in order to adapt to new environments and obstacles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/wired-guide-to-robots/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;WIRED&lt;/a&gt;, sensors, actuators and artificial intelligence (AI) are responsible for allowing robots to develop so much in recent years. Sensors, especially Lidar, have enabled robots to obtain better quality sensory data and thus, quickly identify the world around them. Actuators, such as the ones powered by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/a-clever-new-robotic-muscle-seriously-lifts-bro/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;electricity flowing through oil-fueled pouches&lt;/a&gt;, have given robots greater strength and smoother mobility. AI allows for information and complex calculations to be processed rapidly in real-time and enables the machine to ‘learn’ from its mistakes. Together, these three innovations improve the accuracy, flexibility and power of robots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order for robots to become commercially viable and more effective, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.therobotreport.com/10-biggest-challenges-in-robotics/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Robot Report&lt;/a&gt; explains that robots need to become cheaper, more flexible, more durable, better suited for handling delicate materials, be able to communicate faster and have an improved sense of touch. According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/07/19/678/ai-machine-learning-makes-robots-cheaper-with-same-abilities/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/a&gt;, transfer learning could reduce the cost of testing robots without sacrificing quality. Transfer learning is where robots are first trained with higher-grade sensors and in a controlled environment. Afterward, these robots are able to apply what they learned from the previous testing, and they can then navigate a new chaotic environment with poor sensors faster than a robot without prior training. Furthermore, testing conducted by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tri.global/news/sensing-is-believing-more-sensitive-robot-hands-t-2020-9-9/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Toyota Research Institute&lt;/a&gt; has developed a plausible technique for improving a robot’s ability to handle delicate objects. By using grippers with air-filled elastic bubbles instead of metal or other rigid materials, a robot could gently hold objects. While these solutions will help to address some of the current issues with robots, additional research is required to advance robots enough for complete integration into our everyday lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the future of robots, Dr. Hoffman detailed some viable achievements we may see in the coming years. Fully autonomous driving has become a realistic possibility because more companies like Tesla are investing in this area, and researchers continue to improve machine learning and computer vision. Fully autonomous warehouses and distribution centers, like Amazon, are potentially within reach as the relatively controlled environment of a shipping center is the optimal environment for a robot to function. Moreover, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.roboticsbusinessreview.com/news/infographic-the-evolution-of-robotics-and-automation/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Robotics Business Review&lt;/a&gt; claims the future may see a shift in more automation in manufacturing, especially for wielding together metal and handling rigid objects. According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://ark-invest.com/analyst-research/robots-will-save-manufacturing-billions/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ARK Invest&lt;/a&gt;, although initially more costly, the use of robots in manufacturing has the potential to break even in less than a year and lower employee injury rates. Although real robots do not resemble pop culture, they hold great future potential for enhancing our lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;The image above is an illustration of alien life imagined by humans. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/mach/science/discovery-alien-life-might-not-bring-response-you-d-expect-ncna849046&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;(Apostoli Rossella / Getty Images)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The human species is intelligent, brave and ambitious but not unique. The building blocks of our existence are the same as those of a beetle, a tree or a star. Carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur are the foundation of the entire universe. If these unoriginal elements happen to arrange themselves to form life here on Earth, it is more than likely they have done so somewhere else. The foundations of our being can be traced to stars billions of miles away. With new technologies, like the powerful telescopes such as  Hubble and the study of spectroscopy, “we are now able to map the abundance of all of the major elements found in the human body across hundreds of thousands of stars in our Milky Way,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sdss.org/press-releases/the-elements-of-life-mapped-across-the-milky-way-by-sdssapogee/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;professor at The Ohio State University Jennifer Johnson said.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simple statistics also demonstrate the likelihood of alien existence. There are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2016/hubble-reveals-observable-universe-contains-10-times-more-galaxies-than-previously-thought/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;two billion&lt;/a&gt; known galaxies; each galaxy has billions of stars. The Milky Way Galaxy is home to one hundred billion stars, each with hundreds of orbiting planets. These numbers continue to grow after the launch of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/kepler/in-depth/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kepler space telescope in 2009&lt;/a&gt;, which can detect planets millions of light-years away. Kepler orbits our sun to monitor surrounding stars and compares the data with the observations from ground observatories to process the number of possible planets. Kepler not only detects planets but can detect Earth-like planets that are in the Goldilock zone (a safe distance from the Sun.) According to Kepler’s findings, 40 billion planets have the potential to sustain life.  The number of habitable planets can also be estimated by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.space.com/25219-drake-equation.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Drake equation&lt;/a&gt;, a famous equation created by astronomer Frank Drake to estimate the potential number of habitable planets in the universe.  The equation factors in the rate of expansion of the universe, the average rate of star formation,  along with other factors to estimate that there might be 100 million examples of alien life in the Milky Way alone. Furthermore, the number of planets discovered continues to grow. With these numbers, it is unlikely that humans were the only ones who got lucky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The existence of aliens is sometimes discredited because most planets are too hostile to sustain any form of life. Many argue that the number of planets may be grand, but the number of planets like our own is a little rarer. But studies from our own planet are debunking this notion and proving that life may thrive somewhere else. We are constantly finding life in the most hostile places on Earth (like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn10336-gold-mine-holds-life-untouched-by-the-sun/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;nematode worm&lt;/a&gt;, a specimen found six kilometers below South Africa’s deepest gold mines). Life has also been found deep in the ice in Antarctica, on top of scorching hot volcanoes and all the way in the deep dark ocean. These specimens are called extremophiles (lovers of the extreme) and can survive in extreme cold, heat, acidity and toxicity.  This means it is possible for life to adapt to the freezing temperatures of Neptune, the scorching heat of Mercury, the toxicity of gaseous clouds in Venus and the salty lakes of Mars. Life can sustain itself in the most hostile environments, proving that planets don’t necessarily have to be Earth-like to support organisms. This makes every speck in the night sky a possible home for life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many people, the idea of other living beings thriving somewhere beyond Earth seems far-fetched. This notion puts us all on a pedestal of uniqueness. But science, math, and logic ground us. They make us believe that we are not alone. That we are just one small piece of the giant galactic puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Imagine hiking and looking towards the sky. You start to wonder if humanity has tried to reach out to the aliens above before. With how often humans disagree, you might think we haven’t yet and never will, but contrary to popular belief, we have. Behold the Golden Record.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a warm September day in 1977, NASA launched two spacecraft - Voyager 1 and 2. What did their journeys entail? They went to Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and out of our Solar System. But according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bOzhebLqp8&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Aperture&lt;/a&gt;, this wasn’t the original mission. They were originally planned to only explore Jupiter and Saturn, along with their respective moons and surroundings; however, that goal quickly changed. They realized the planets were reaching an optimal layout that aligned with the path of these two spacecraft. They could use these planets in a “gravitational assist”, or a planetary slingshot, where the spacecraft would utilize the gravity of the planets to propel it forward faster. This would allow the spacecraft to reach higher speeds with less fuel. The scientists decided to gamble with this risk and go further than just Jupiter or Saturn. This gamble paid off. Both of the spacecraft have left our solar system and are traveling millions of miles every day. The spacecraft are equipped with machinery that can take pictures or detect cosmic rays. However, the spacecraft contains more than just measuring equipment. The history of all humankind is etched onto disks called the Golden Records.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Golden Records are phonographic records, another name for a vinyl record, that have graphics meant to be seen by aliens. Carl Sagan, a leader in America’s space program since the start, was one of the people who were asked to make these plaques. By the end of the prototyping process, Sagan and his team were not only asked to create drawings, but they were asked for pictures and music as well. This was done with the phonographic records.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The records were originally only able to hold 30 minutes of content, but through some technological advancements, the time was increased to 90 minutes. The curators of these records then faced the most daunting task of all: capturing all of humanity in a mere 90 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When originally choosing the information that would make it onto the record, the guiding principle was the basics of science, math and nature. However, one must question if this was really what we wanted to show aliens that we have never been in contact with. Did we want to tell them that we knew how to solve for x or know that the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell? The team at NASA realized that humanity represented much more. So they eventually started to gather pictures and sounds to capture the human condition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They wanted the information to be as representative of the human population as possible, which was easier said than done. In the 1970s, there was no Google, Spotify nor Dropbox. If you wanted a copy of some material, you needed to go out and get a physical copy of it. And that’s exactly what the team at NASA did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They wanted the materials to represent human emotion and eventually decided on music - an accurate representation of the human emotional state. According to Aperture, they had music from Bach and Beethoven, so they could show the mathematical properties of music. However, they covered music from around the world, including that of India and China. Along with music, the records contain EGI scans of Carl Sagan and his wife, the day after he proposed, in the hopes that some advanced civilization would figure out how to collect our thoughts through these scans. There is also a group of audio recordings that starts with sounds from nature like thunder and volcanos and gradually transmutates into modern sounds like the launch of the Saturn V rocket. There are also greetings from 55 different languages on the record, including one very famous greeting from Carl Sagan’s own son: “Hello from the children of planet Earth.” Then there are 150 pictures stored in analog form. Some of these pictures reveal the grandeur of humanity, while others are purely abstract, demonstrating the creativity of humans in making something out of nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we were to create the Golden Records today, we would have a much longer run time or higher quality photos. But maybe the limitation of the time was for the better. It helped us say some things out loud while leaving other things unsaid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;Alzheimer's disease is a progressive condition that causes the degeneration and death of brain cells. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pmlive.com/pharma_intelligence/Detecting_Alzheimers_ahead_of_a_cure_1301233&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;(PMLiVE)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
According to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/alzheimers-disease-fact-sheet&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt; (NIH), &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/what-is-alzheimers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt; is the most prevalent type of dementia, affecting more than 5.5 million Americans. Abnormal protein accumulation, called amyloid plaques and tau tangles, steadily kill brain cells and the connections between them in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s, hindering the capacity of individuals to think and remember. The effects are permanent, and there is no treatment yet for Alzheimer’s. To find one, scientists worldwide are working in high gear, but most medicines that have entered clinical trials have failed.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
There are two types of Alzheimer’s: early-onset and late-onset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typically, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alz.org/help-support/i-have-alz/younger-onset&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;early-onset Alzheimer’s&lt;/a&gt; affects individuals before age 65, with the signs typically occurring in a person’s 40s or 50s. According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alzheimers-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20350447&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, this type of disorder is rare, affecting only 5% of all people with Alzheimer’s. It is a direct result of hereditary mutations in one of the three genes: APP, PSEN1 or PSEN2. What researchers have discovered from these unusual mutations that cause early-onset Alzheimer’s is that the mutation of the gene leads to the overproduction of a rogue, harmful beta-amyloid protein. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/what-is-alzheimers/brain_tour&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The beta-amyloid&lt;/a&gt; build-up in the brain develops plaques that are one of the disease’s hallmarks. Just as plaques in the arteries can affect the heart, plaques in the brain can have dire effects on the function of the brain. For the disease to manifest, a person needs to inherit only one of these genes from one parent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
However, the vast majority of Alzheimer’s cases are the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.webmd.com/alzheimers/guide/alzheimers-types&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;late-onset&lt;/a&gt; type, which usually affects individuals over 65 years of age. Alzheimer’s late-onset condition is not usually inherited; instead, it is likely to be derived from a combination of genetic, environmental and lifestyle causes. It is believed that a mutation in a gene called ApoE raises the likelihood of a person developing late-onset Alzheimer’s, but does not cause it. According to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/APOE&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;NIH&lt;/a&gt;, ApoE affects how cholesterol flows through the blood. Research indicates that there is an increased risk of developing Alzheimer’s in people with elevated blood pressure and high cholesterol. Radiation, concussions, injuries and exposure to some contaminants are possible environmental factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what is the cause of Alzheimer’s disease?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Headlines of revolutionary news have reverberated through the network in recent years- Alzheimer’s disease is not just a disease, it’s an infection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hypothesis that bacterial or viral infections could play a role in Alzheimer’s development was unpopularized until about a year ago. However, recently, as scientists have worked out potential pathways for how an infection could lead to the development of these irregular protein buildups in the brain, this concept has gained traction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers announced the discovery of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porphyromonas_gingivalis&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Porphyromonas gingivalis&lt;/a&gt; – the pathogen behind &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_periodontitis&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;chronic periodontitis&lt;/a&gt;, or gum disease – in the brains of deceased Alzheimer’s patients, in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6357742/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; led by senior author Jan Potempa, a microbiologist from the University of Louisville. Although experts are still trying to isolate the exact causes of this illness, a litany of papers argues that the deadly spread of Alzheimer’s goes far beyond what we used to think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report that spurred the headlines was published in the journal &lt;a href=&quot;https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aau3333&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Science Advances&lt;/a&gt;. It was reported that gum disease could be a cause of Alzheimer’s. It’s not the first time that the two variables have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1532-5415.2010.02788.x&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;related&lt;/a&gt;, but the researchers have gone further. Oral infection with the pathogen led to brain colonization by bacteria in separate experiments with mice, along with increased development of amyloid-beta (Aβ), a sticky protein usually associated with Alzheimer’s. Additionally, in the brains of Alzheimer’s patients, the team identified toxic enzymes called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingipain&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;gingipains&lt;/a&gt; secreted by bacteria. But these tests were conducted after the patients have been deceased. In other words, although P. gingivalis and the disease have been related before, it has never been known whether gum disease causes Alzheimer’s, or whether dementia leads to poor oral treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogs/2020/november/alzheimerFour.png&quot; width=&quot;60%&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin: 0 auto&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;P. gingivalis' gingipains (red) are among neurons in the brain of a patient with Alzheimer's.&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencealert.com/new-evidence-reveals-an-unexpected-culprit-behind-alzheimer-s-disease&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; (Science Alert)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The researchers write &lt;a href=&quot;https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/1/eaau3333&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;in their paper&lt;/a&gt; that their discovery of gingipain antigens in the brains of people with  AD and also with AD pathology indicates that a P. gingivalis brain infection is not a consequence of late-stage disease, but rather an early occurrence. This may explain the pathology observed before cognitive impairment in middle-aged people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many experiments have been performed on mice looking at late-stage Alzheimer’s; some have been successful, some have not. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cortexyme.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Cortexyme&lt;/a&gt;, a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, is currently advancing its lead therapeutic candidate, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cortexyme.com/pipeline/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Atuzaginstat (COR388)&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gaintrial.com/en/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;GAIN Trial&lt;/a&gt; (an ongoing Phase 2/3 clinical trial in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease). In experiments with mice, COR388 showed that it could minimize the bacterial load of existing brain infection with P. gingivalis while also reducing the development of amyloid-beta and neuroinflammation (inflammation of the nervous tissue).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in humans, even the successful ones have failed. From 1998 to 2017, there were around 146 unsuccessful attempts to develop Alzheimer’s medications, and another half-dozen or so were &lt;a href=&quot;http://phrma-docs.phrma.org/files/dmfile/AlzheimersSetbacksSteppingStones_FINAL_digital.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;registered&lt;/a&gt; in 2018. A drug, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alzforum.org/therapeutics/crenezumab&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Crenezumab&lt;/a&gt; seemed successful, but the interim review indicated that the drug was unlikely to reach the primary endpoint of the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) Score improvement from baseline. So the tests conducted in mice shouldn’t yet be considered as proof that it is a cause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many scientists in this area expect that they will soon discover that the causes of Alzheimer’s are vast. While most medications that have been developed to target Alzheimer’s have failed early in clinical trials, there are still many trials underway, and more to come in the future. Scientists expect that they will soon discover that Alzheimer’s causes are many and believe that we are entering the golden age of Alzheimer’s research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what can we do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/aging/aginginfo/alzheimers.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;, there is growing evidence that physical, mental and social behaviors decrease the likelihood of developing Alzheimer’s. The ability to reliably track memory and other cognitive functions in later life is a crucial factor in avoiding the onset of impairment of Alzheimer’s and other dementias. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cambridgecognition.com/products/digital-healthcare-technology/cantab-mobile/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CANTAB Mobile&lt;/a&gt; is a diagnostic software available to GPs that is easy to use to objectively test memory in older adults who are concerned about their risk of dementia. For now, individuals should lead a healthier lifestyle to lower their risk of contracting the disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogs/2020/november/darkMatterOne.jpg&quot; width=&quot;60%&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin: 0 auto&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
One of the biggest and most influential mysteries in the universe is dark matter. Although a lot of people are probably familiar with the topic of dark matter itself, seldom do people understand its correlation to the universe. Dark matter affects the universe in ways that cannot be fully interpreted by scientists and astronomers on Earth. In fact, only five percent of the universe is occupied by normal matter, and the rest of it is occupied by dark matter and dark energy. Dark matter occupies 26 percent of the universe while dark energy (the force which results in the expansion of the universe) occupies 68 percent of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now let us take a look at what dark matter is. Dark matter has not been defined yet, and cannot be defined until and unless its existence can be justified with 100% definitive proof. Although there are various pieces of evidence that support the existence of dark matter, its presence has not been verified. Until then, all that has been observed are glimpses of its properties. Some of the properties are as follows: dark matter interacts with normal matter only on a gravitational and weak level, does not emit or absorb light, and its particles move much slower than the speed of light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are some of the basic properties that have been observed and dark matter is expected to have. Now, the question that arises is, why are we not able to detect dark matter? And how are we able to interpret the chance of its existence if we could not detect it? To address the first question, since dark matter cannot interact directly with light, it cannot interact with or be identified by electromagnetic radiation, which is the way normal matter is identified. Despite this, scientists have been able to theorize the presence of dark matter through the unknown additional mass discovered while evaluating the mass of a particular galaxy. One of the most significant theories is that dark matter is essential for binding a galaxy together. How? Dark matter exerts a gravitational force, which results in the attraction of matter towards it. Since there is so much dark matter in the universe, it helps in meshing galaxies together, like a giant spider web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
But again, all of these are circumstantial theories put out by scientists, and nothing can be confirmed until the presence of dark matter is proven. Thankfully, we are getting closer and closer to finding the truth as technology advances. Scientists have identified particular hotspots in the universe where dark matter could be accumulated, and have termed these as dark matter maps. There are also dark matter labs made on Earth, which have been seated deep underground in order to collect the tiniest and most insignificant signals from the universe to help provide evidence of the existence of dark matter. People from all over the world are trying to piece this jigsaw together, and once it is complete, it may change the entire notion of the cosmos for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Memories have been a subject of interest to scientists from an early age. In fact, the study of memories dates back over 2,000 years to Aristotle’s disquisition “On the Soul”, outlining the belief that humans are born without knowledge. Today, the study of memory is a part of the field of cognitive neuroscience, and the ways in which memories change over time are of particular interest to researchers. Understanding these concepts is vital to developments in research concerning the causes of memory loss, particularly with regards to Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1968, scientists Richard Atkinson and Richard Shiffrin created the Atkinson-Shiffrin memory model that introduced three general types of memory: sensory memory, short-term memory and long-term memory. Although alternate theories exist, this model has been the most widely used and accepted. Following these three types, there are three stages of memory processing: encoding, storage and retrieval, each playing a vital role in the overall structure of memories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sensory memory is the first stage in memory storage and is responsible for retrieving physical and chemical stimuli from our surroundings. Examples of stimuli include visual, audible and tactile experiences. Every environmental stimulus triggers neuronal activities, transmitting the information to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What allows these stimuli to be transformed into memories? According to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://qbi.uq.edu.au/brain-basics/memory/how-are-memories-formed&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Queensland Brain Institute&lt;/a&gt;, the answer lies in synaptic plasticity, the process by which the strength of connections between brain cells—known as synapses—undergo changes. The frequency of activating the synapses controls their strength. And when a neuron is stimulated, it can begin an action potential, a change in the electrical potential of a neuron. If the cell’s membrane reaches the threshold potential, the signal is transmitted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, according to cognitive psychologist George Sperling, sensory memory has limited capacity and duration. In fact, the majority of stimuli are not strong enough to begin the encoding process necessary to turn an experience into a memory. But if the information does become sensory memory, it continues on to the second stage: short-term memory. Though longer than sensory memory, short-term memory only lasts 15 to 30 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;This model provides a summary of the stages of memory. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opentextbooks.org.hk/ditatopic/27122&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;(Open Textbooks of Hong Kong)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Short-term memory has been studied extensively in the past. In 1956, George Miller researched the capacity of short-term memory. He ran studies on how people respond to a variety of stimuli. In one trial, he presented each participant with 10 different sounds varying in pitch and had the participant respond to each pitch with a corresponding response previously learned. Miller summarized his studies in his paper “The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two”. He concluded that the majority of humans can process between five and nine units of information in their short-term memory. Miller’s theory provides great insight into the limited nature of memory, helping explain why people have such difficulty remembering large amounts of information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although short-term memory is significantly limited, long-term memory has the potential to store an unlimited amount of information for one’s entire life. Scientist Alice Preston of the University of Texas explained how the passage of time is required for short-term memory to become long-term memory. Time allows the memory to become resistant to other stimuli that may be competing to be turned into long-term memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, Preston detailed that molecular changes alter the structure of neurons. Although these changes also occur for sensory and short-term memory, they take much longer for information that needs to be converted to long-term memory (sometimes taking years). Ironically, time, the factor responsible for preserving memories, is also the factor that can cause memory loss. As outlined by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3898682/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;National Center for Biotechnology Information&lt;/a&gt;, a study performed by Holger Jahn on “Memory loss in Alzheimer’s disease” explores the relationship between memories and Alzheimer’s disease, focusing on the factors that influence this loss of memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is vital to note that the termination of synapses is a major contributor to memory loss. During this discussion, Jahn scripts, “Variations in the genes encoding the amyloid precursor proteins, presenilin-1 and presenilin-2, can directly cause Alzheimer’s disease.” Presenilin 1 is responsible for cleaving other proteins into peptides, a process called proteolysis. Hence, when these variations occur, the presenilin proteins stop functioning, resulting in an inability to digest certain proteins, particularly the amyloid β-peptide. This ultimately leads to an increase in the vulnerability of the brain, contributing to the early phases of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Jahn also notes, “The neuropathological hallmarks of the atrophy process in AD are the presence of senile plaques (amyloid deposits) and neurofibrillary tangles in autopsied brains.” Senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are natural components of the brain, but large numbers of them are a characteristic of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neurofibrillary tangles block the neuron transport system, impairing connectivity and communication between brain cells through synapses. As mentioned previously, these connections are vital to memory storage, illustrating the consequences of the buildup of neurofibrillary tangles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the exact nature of such atrophy is not completely understood, a variety of factors may be at play. Common causes of Alzheimer’s disease include age, genetics and environmental factors, depending on the individual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the uncertainty over its cause, it is evident that memories are a fundamental component of Alzheimer’s disease. Evidently, further research is required for advancements to be made in this field. Memory loss impacts the world we live in and can bring many difficulties to people’s lives in the form of Alzheimer’s disease. Thus, scientists and researchers must continue to study the nature of memory loss and ways to prevent it.&lt;/p&gt;
