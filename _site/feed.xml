&lt;a href=&quot;https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/exoplanet-catalog/5471/kepler-452-b/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kepler-452b&lt;/a&gt; is a planet that exists light-years away from us. The planet can and most likely once did support life. But what exactly does this planet have to offer? Are there any downsides that may disrupt the possibility of the planet supporting life?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To begin with, Kepler-452b is an &lt;a href=&quot;https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;exoplanet&lt;/a&gt; located 1,402 light-years away from Earth. Its appearance is similar to Earth, having an atmosphere, water and land. And similar to how the Earth has the sun, Kepler-452b orbits around Kepler-452, a star 6 billion years old, which is pretty old in comparison to the solar system’s sun, aged 4.5 billion years. But Kepler-452 has around the same temperature as the sun, which can support the idea that Kepler-452b can still harbor life. Whether or not it has a moon is unknown as of now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it may sound bizarre that Kepler-452b and Earth are similar, it’s true. Other than the facts stated previously, what other aspects do both planets have? First off, water. Last year, water was discovered on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02751-1#:~:text=The%20discovery%2C%20reported%20on%2028,orbiting%20spacecraft%2C%20called%20Mars%20Express.&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mars&lt;/a&gt;. This was a huge discovery because it hints that Mars once supported life. But Kepler-452b is an especially unique case because it has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.space.com/30034-earth-cousin-exoplanet-kepler-452b-life.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;lakes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.space.com/30034-earth-cousin-exoplanet-kepler-452b-life.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;rivers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.space.com/30034-earth-cousin-exoplanet-kepler-452b-life.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;pools&lt;/a&gt;. There were once oceans, but unfortunately, all of them have dried up. Unlike &lt;a href=&quot;https://coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu/ask/80-Can-we-breathe-on-Mars-#:~:text=Mars%20does%20have%20an%20atmosphere,with%20oxygen%20to%20work%20outdoors.&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mars&lt;/a&gt;, the atmosphere might be actually breathable. The air on Mars is 100 times thinner than that of Earth, compared to Kepler-452b where the air is pretty similar to that of Earth. However, this topic is still in &lt;a href=&quot;https://education.abc.net.au/newsandarticles/blog/-/b/3345118/curious-kids-could-humans-live-on-kepler-452-b&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;debate&lt;/a&gt; because we do not know what is in the air, especially if there is something more dangerous in it than Earth’s nitrogen and oxygen. The temperature on Kepler-452b is slightly &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler-452b#:~:text=The%20planet%20takes%20385%20Earth,a%20little%20warmer%20than%20Earth.&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;warmer&lt;/a&gt; than Earth but is still as livable as a warm day on Earth. The appearance, as mentioned, is almost exactly the same. The majority of the outside view is blue, indicating water, with patches of land. Both orbit around a star that is roughly the same temperature and have clouds. But just because they are similar in a handful of aspects doesn’t mean Kepler-452b is Earth. In fact, they are pretty different in quite a few ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First off, the sun of Kepler-452b or Kepler-452contrasts with our sun. Kepler-452 is also 20% brighter than the sun, as well as 11% larger. The terrain of Kepler-452b is rocky, which is different from Earth’s variety of landforms. Not only are the landforms bigger, Kepler-452b is actually &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-kepler-mission-discovers-bigger-older-cousin-to-earth/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;60%&lt;/a&gt; larger in diameter, meaning it is 1.6 times bigger than Earth. The gigantic size difference between both planet and exoplanet is what gives Kepler-452b the title of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/what-is-an-exoplanet/planet-types/super-earth/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Super-Earth&lt;/a&gt;. The exoplanet is also rather massive, having &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler-452b#:~:text=Kepler%2D452b%20has%20a%20probable,exoplanets%20are%20only%20rough%20estimates.&amp;amp;text=Its%20radius%20is%2050%25%20bigger,zone%20of%20its%20parent%20star.&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;5 times&lt;/a&gt; as much mass as the Earth. The surface gravity is about 2 times as much as the gravity on Earth, resulting in jumping being twice as hard. A complete revolution on the Earth, 365 days, is considered a year. For Kepler-452b however, it takes &lt;a href=&quot;https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/resources/282/comparison-between-earth-and-kepler-452b-and-their-host-stars/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;385&lt;/a&gt; days to complete a full revolution around its star, resulting in a 385 day year. Earth has “only” existed for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nationalgeographic.org/topics/resource-library-age-earth/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;4.54&lt;/a&gt; billion years, but Kepler-452b is estimated to have the age of &lt;a href=&quot;https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/exoplanet-catalog/5471/kepler-452-b/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt; billion!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kepler-452b is by no means Earth. Earth has all of our needs: natural fruits and vegetables, food sources such as meat, oceans for trade— the full bundle. Kepler-452b has a handful of that. Whether or not Kepler-452b has life or had life is not known yet. The question of whether humans can live on this planet, even if they did bring their own supply, is in debate. The temperature is nice, sure, but is the environment habitable? Will the air have any metals that are potentially lethal or just not safe? Can it really harbor human life? The short answer for this is yes, no, maybe so. We do not know if the planet has everything we need, but one thing can be sure: it comes really close to that point, with water, land, weather and all. Maybe someday in the future, we’ll know for sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, Kepler-452b is more or less similar to Earth. In fact, there are dozens upon dozens of Kepler planets! Kepler is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/kepler/overview/index.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;NASA mission&lt;/a&gt; to discover hundreds of Earth-like planets, and to this point up to 24 potential exoplanets may be even better than the conditions of Earth, but of all of them Kepler-452b will always be one of the likeliest candidates, and for good reason too! However, although all these amazing planets have been found, remember that they are not in our solar system, and by no means within reach. Being thousands of light-years is too far for human travel, and all purposes of looking for them are merely to answer the question “Are we alone in this universe?” or “Are there others like us?”. So even though planets as amazing as Kepler-452b and all of the other exoplanets are out there, the chance of actually inhabiting one of the candidates is near impossible. However, it is important to know that somewhere out there, such an amazing planet actually exists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;The high stakes involved with Bitcoin have only made its value soar higher than ever before. &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/four-factors-driving-the-price-of-bitcoin-87244&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;(The Conversation)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Launched in 2009 from the anonymous Satoshi Nakamoto’s whitepaper, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bitcoin.asp&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bitcoin&lt;/a&gt; (BTC) was created to be an electronic payment system “based on cryptographic proof instead of trust.” Bitcoin is now the world’s largest cryptocurrency (digital currency) with an astonishing value of over $55,000 for a single coin and is also the first application of blockchain technology, an innovative creation that allows it to be distributed, traded and stored. A blockchain is essentially a collection of “blocks,” files that record all of the transactions that occur, making them transparent and visible to all of the computers that run Bitcoin’s code and store its blockchain. The creation of Bitcoin has united thousands of people around the world over a common goal: obtaining bitcoin and turning a profit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are currently 12,000 computers connected to Bitcoin’s blockchain; these computers are called nodes, while the owners of the computers are called miners - the miners control Bitcoin’s release into circulation via a process called Bitcoin mining and are rewarded with coins adding blocks to the blockchain. Bitcoin mining requires the solving of complex computational puzzles in order to discover a new block, and expensive mining rigs (elaborate mining processors and hardware) increase a miner’s ability to earn more rewards. Mining rigs are available for purchase in the form of computer chips like Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC) and Graphic Processing Units (GPUs). All of these Bitcoin transactions are verified by cryptographic proof, making the system very secure. For example, a person with malicious intent would need to operate 51% of the total computing power that makes up Bitcoin to cheat the system. With miners acting as Bitcoin’s decentralized authority, miners are motivated to add to the growing blockchain because of the prospect of reward, and the blockchain benefits by growing and developing even more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While David Zeiler, cryptocurrency expert for Money Morning, describes Bitcoin as “the best-known crypto and a secure, decentralized currency that has become a store of value like gold,” there may be more exaggeration than truth in his statement. The long-term security that Zeiler describes only refers to Bitcoin’s official certification and verifiability, not Bitcoin’s prices. Cryptocurrency is a highly speculative investment, with the potential for intense price swings, or as described in the words of CEO of Digital Currency Group Barry Silbert, “It is pretty much the highest-risk, highest-return investment that you can possibly make.” As a safeguard against these risks, it is highly recommended that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/what-is-cryptocurrency/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;investors&lt;/a&gt; trade on official cryptocurrency exchanges, such as Coin base and Bitfinex. Potential investors and traders are enticed by Bitcoin’s high exchange rate, lower transaction fees and instant payments that are a result of its “peer-to-peer” technology that grants instant rewards. In addition, Bitcoin can also be exchanged for traditional currencies and act as an alternative to national fiat money and traditional commodities like gold. The overall success of Bitcoin has triggered the release of a slew of other cryptocurrencies, amounting to over 5,000 different types released into circulation, collectively referred to as altcoins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As another facet of its multipurpose nature, Bitcoin can also be used to buy things! Bitcoin can be split into smaller units to make transactions easier - the common unit of Bitcoin used in everyday transactions is called the Satoshi, which is 100 millionths of a Bitcoin, currently worth approximately 0.02 cents. In response to the growing Bitcoin community, many retailers have begun to accept bitcoin with the proper hardware terminal and/or wallet address through QR codes and touch screen apps. Keys are the main form of hardware terminal through which Bitcoin can be transferred: there are public and private keys, both of which are long strings of numbers and letters linked through the mathematical encryption algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogs/2021/april/btcTwo.png&quot; width=&quot;60%&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin: 0 auto&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;An example of Bitcoin’s private and public keys.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://coinsource.net/private-keys-public-keys-addresses-and-wallets/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;(Coinsource)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A &lt;a href=&quot;https://coinsource.net/private-keys-public-keys-addresses-and-wallets/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;public&lt;/a&gt; key’s address is published to the world and others may send bitcoins to it as necessary. On the other hand, private keys are a guarded secret and only used to authorize personal bitcoin transmissions. Keys increase Bitcoin’s liquidity by making Bitcoins less like stocks and more like cash because the private keys needed to authorize spending can be printed out and stored physically. Stores may also accept Bitcoin wallets, a physical or digital device that facilitates the trading of bitcoin and allows users to track ownership of coins with a software program that interacts with the blockchain, allowing users to exchange the currency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin’s appeal has been greatly increasing in recent years, especially because Bitcoin quickly approaches its approvable max of 21 million bitcoin. With a current count of about 18,614,806 in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investopedia.com/tech/what-happens-bitcoin-after-21-million-mined/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;circulation&lt;/a&gt;, there are only about 3 million Bitcoins left to be mined. This makes it seem like Bitcoin will run out soon, sending miners and investors into a frenzy. However, this is not the case because rewards are halved for every 210,000 blocks added to Bitcoin’s blockchain; the current reward for each block discovery has become a meager 6.25 bitcoins (of course, if you take into account the value of a single Bitcoin, then the overall value of the reward is greater than ever). If you think about how a store of 3 million Bitcoins gets depleted by withdrawals of 6.25 bitcoins, you will understand how, in reality, Bitcoin will actually “run out” in around 2140.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin continues to be the leader and definer of the cryptocurrency value cycle; the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor/2021/02/12/bitcoin-price-prediction-2021-where-is-the-top/?sh=31480e9c3ed0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;prices&lt;/a&gt; of bitcoin and Ethereum (another cryptocurrency) are currently riding a FOMO-driven high, going almost vertical. The direction and stability of these high prices are very unpredictable, or, in the words of Clem Chambers, “a week is now a long time in crypto” due to its extreme volatility. Investors can monitor transaction fees as a sign of Bitcoin’s upcoming value - transaction fees are now exorbitant; when transaction fees start to fall it will be a signal that the FOMO is falling, and the prices will drop. For now though, the fees continue to rapidly increase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;Google Trends shows interest in bitcoin, Ethereum, DeFi (decentralized finance) and stocks.

&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
As a child of the 21st century, Bitcoin is, and will no doubt continue to be at the forefront of the digital currency revolution. Versatile and secure, investable and ever-expanding, Satoshi Nakamoto’s application of blockchain technology has blossomed into proportions that must have been unimaginable before its creation. Microsoft, Home Depot, Burger King, Starbucks: all of these major retailers have started the movement of accepting Bitcoin and other forms of cryptocurrency as a form of payment. Who knows? One day, Bitcoin may become the new dollar bill - as liquid as cash, and accepted anywhere and everywhere. Only time will tell how the wonders of Bitcoin and its siblings will transform the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sydney Hollingsworth. 04/16/2021&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogs/2021/april/urchinOne.png&quot; width=&quot;60%&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin: 0 auto&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;Where a kelp forest once stood, a “purple carpet” of sea urchins now covers the seafloor.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2021/03/31/975800880/in-hotter-climate-zombie-urchins-are-winning-and-kelp-forests-are-losing&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;(Steve Lonhart / NOAA Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The waters along the Californian coast contain a rich variety of marine life. From seals to colorful crustaceans to whales, thousands of species make their homes in the reefs and kelp forests near the rocky beaches of North America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, a common theme among delicately balanced ecosystems around the world is the threat of destruction posed by human activities, and California’s marine landscape is no exception. The towering underwater forests, composed of 60 feet tall &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.montereybayaquarium.org/animals/animals-a-to-z/bull-kelp&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;bull kelp&lt;/a&gt; stems, are facing annihilation at the hands of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.montereybayaquarium.org/animals/animals-a-to-z/purple-sea-urchin&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;purple sea urchin&lt;/a&gt; population, which has swung wildly out of control and decimated 95% of California’s kelp forests since 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike most other situations where an organism introduced by humans outcompetes an entire ecosystem, the purple sea urchin is actually &lt;a href=&quot;https://goldenstate.is/culling-excess-sea-urchin-to-save-southern-california-kelp-beds/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;native to California&lt;/a&gt;, not an invasive species. This means there is still hope that balance can be reestablished without the removal of the purple sea urchin entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The emergence of this problem can be traced all the way back to the 1800s, when sea otters, a main predator of the purple sea urchin, were hunted nearly to extinction for their waterproof skins. More recently, a toxic algal bloom in 2011 killed off many marine species, including the sunflower sea star. Additionally, the sea stars were threatened further in 2013 by a mysterious “&lt;a href=&quot;https://marine.ucsc.edu/data-products/sea-star-wasting/index.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;sea star wasting syndrome&lt;/a&gt;”, which causes the stars to decay and lose their limbs, eventually resulting in death. With its 20 limbs and large diameter of up to one meter, the sunflower sea star was once a fearsome predator of the purple sea urchin but is currently considered critically endangered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another factor contributing to the declining bull kelp population is global warming. Increasingly common heat waves since 2014 mean a less nutrient-rich water supply for all marine life, including the annually released bull kelp spores. The warmer temperatures may also worsen the effects of sea star wasting syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together, these events have resulted in less than favorable conditions for the keystone species that is the bull kelp and created a virtually predator-free environment for the purple sea urchin. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2021/03/31/975800880/in-hotter-climate-zombie-urchins-are-winning-and-kelp-forests-are-losing&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Urchin barrens&lt;/a&gt; are vast areas where thick kelp forests have been completely replaced by sea urchins. The hordes of spikey bodies cover the seafloor with what has been called a “purple carpet”, as the healthy number of 2 urchins per square meter has been replaced by 70 individuals in the same space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW), if the bull kelp spores cannot set for more than three years in a row, the forests could &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20200310-the-sea-urchin-combatting-the-effects-of-climate-change&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;disappear completely&lt;/a&gt;, and take countless species with them. Besides providing food and shelter for marine life, bull kelp also help control wave activity and reduce coastal erosion. Thus, its disappearance would endanger marine life, as well as harm local commercial fishers and economies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, marine biologists believe this problem is fixable, and with the right efforts, the purple sea urchin population can be regulated and bull kelp forests can be returned to their former glory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main plan of many organizations involved in the bull kelp conservation effort is to remove purple sea urchins by hand until their natural predators can be rehabilitated. Purple sea urchins are edible, and quite delicious when prepared correctly. Urchin removal projects often obtain funding from selling harvested urchins to restaurants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, one problem with this plan is that due to their abundance, most purple urchins are underfed and far too small to compare to the more favorable red sea urchin, which is considerably larger. To find a solution to this, researchers at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2019/09/09/756929657/saving-californias-kelp-forest-may-depend-on-eating-purple-sea-urchins&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Moss Landing Marine Laboratories Center of Aquaculture&lt;/a&gt; tried feeding captured purple urchins red algae, which helped them grow to market size in just eight weeks. This means purple sea urchins can be captured, fed, and sold to restaurants, all while giving the bull kelp forests a chance to grow back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second-largest setback purple sea urchin harvesting groups have encountered is that sea urchin is not a very popular dish, particularly in California. Some organizations, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.urchinomics.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Urchinomics&lt;/a&gt;, a Norway-based company that faces a similar problem, ship their urchins to Japan, where urchin gonads, called uni, make a popular dish that tastes similar to the oyster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, shipping to international markets does not even start to cover all the purple sea urchins that must be removed to restore California’s marine ecosystem. Without local markets, the urchins will end up as compost, and conservation efforts will lose funding opportunities to continue their projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the removal of hundreds of millions of purple sea urchins may seem like a substantial feat, most researchers and volunteers agree that it is very plausible if we act soon. In addition, helping restore California’s kelp forests doesn’t have to feel like a chore; trying new foods and supporting small restaurants can benefit everyone involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With so many crises beyond the control of individuals, especially regarding the current biodiversity crisis, it’s always good to hear there is something you, personally, can do. Bull kelp is essential to the health of California’s wildlife; managing the purple sea urchin population can directly help over 700 species that rely on kelp forests and be fun, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;Emmanuelle Charpentier (left) and Jennifer Doudna (right) win the 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for CRISPR gene-editing. &lt;a href=&quot;https://scroll.in/article/975260/what-is-crispr-explaining-the-gene-editing-technology-that-won-the-2020-chemistry-nobel-prize&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;(Scroll)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Researcher Emmanuelle Charpentier and biochemist Jennifer Doudna were initially studying the immune system of a Streptococcus bacterium in hopes of developing a new antibiotic, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2020/popular-information/#:~:text=Emmanuelle%20Charpentier%20and%20Jennifer%20Doudna,microorganisms%20with%20extremely%20high%20precision.&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Nobel Prize&lt;/a&gt;. But akin to other remarkable discoveries, this one didn’t exactly go as planned. Instead, the pair discovered a molecular tool called CRISPR which can be used to make defined cuts in genetic material, presenting an endless array of possibilities for the future of gene-editing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats, also known as CRISPR, are DNA sequences that are naturally found in bacteria. These repeats are actually a collection of mug shots captured by CRISPR associated proteins (Cas). The mug shots are DNA pieces that Cas cut from invaders that attack the bacteria. The snipped DNA fragment is then stored between the palindromic CRISPR sequences to maintain a genetic memory for halting future infections from the same invader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until recently, “CRISPR-Cas9” —often called CRISPR for short— has only been known as genetic information that some bacteria use as part of their defense mechanism against viruses. Now, as a gene-editing tool, CRISPR-Cas9 has reformed biomedical research and may soon enable medical breakthroughs in a way few biological innovations have before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How it works&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogs/2021/april/geneticTwo.png&quot; width=&quot;40%&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin: 0 auto&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;The diagram shows the mechanism of action of CRISPR. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yourgenome.org/facts/what-is-crispr-cas9&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;(YourGenome)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Editing genes with CRISPR-Cas9 occurs by cutting DNA at a particular site and then letting the natural DNA repair processes take over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CRISPR relies on just two components: the molecular scissors (Cas9) and the guide RNA (gRNA), which works as a GPS, guiding Cas9 to the appropriate site. According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.synthego.com/guide/how-to-use-crispr/sgrna#:~:text=In%20this%20document%2C%20we%20have,into%20a%20single%20RNA%20molecule.&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Synthego&lt;/a&gt;, gRNA itself consists of two parts. These include the CRISPR RNA (crRNA), which is a sequence complementary to the target DNA, and a tracrRNA, which serves as a binding scaffold for the Cas protein. The crRNA part of the gRNA is the customizable one and can be modified into virtually any sequence, which allows specificity in every CRISPR experiment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The guide RNA shepherds Cas9 to the precise spot on DNA where a cut has been called for by pairing up with the region of the DNA it has targeted. Cas9 then locks onto the double-stranded DNA and unzips it, allowing it to snip the DNA at the requested spot. This results in a break in both strands of the DNA molecule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cell, sensing a problem, repairs the break. Cells usually repair a break in their DNA by gluing the loose ends back together using DNA ligase. This repair mechanism is not an orderly process, as it typically involves the loss or addition of some nucleotides at the cut site. That often results in a mistake that disables a gene, which may not sound convenient— but sometimes it is. This is why:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientists cut DNA with CRISPR-Cas9 to induce changes, also known as mutations. They can understand what a protein’s actual role is by comparing cells with the mutation to ones without the mutation. A new mutation may also help them understand genetic diseases. Additionally, CRISPR-Cas9 can be useful in human cells by disabling certain genes, like ones that play a role in inherited diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the RNA biologist &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenewsforstudents.org/article/explainer-how-crispr-works&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Gene Yeo&lt;/a&gt;, Cas9 was originally equivalent to a Swiss army knife that has only one function: cutting. But securing proteins to those jaded blades has turned them into a multifunctional tool. CRISPR-Cas9 can now be used in new ways, such as changing a single nitrogenous base or adding a fluorescent protein to tag a spot in the DNA that scientists want to track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Applications&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CRISPR’s potential applications include correcting genetic defects, treating and preventing the spread of diseases and improving crops. Many common diseases, including heart conditions, Alzheimer’s and diabetes, are partly caused by genes; people who inherit the mutated variants of certain genes are more susceptible to the disease. For many of these conditions, the genetic component is complicated because more than one gene is involved. So for now, scientists are looking to treat diseases that are the result of a single mutated gene that is easy to target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some blood disorders, like sickle-cell anemia, fit the bill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sickle-cell anemia is an inherited red blood cell disorder in which the round red blood cells become deformed and resemble sickles or crescent moons. This deformation makes the cells prone to sticking in blood vessels and blocking blood flow to the surrounding tissues. Sickle-cell anemia is the result of a mutation in the hemoglobin gene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;The diagram shows the difference between normal red blood cells and the mutated ones.&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aboutkidshealth.ca/article?contentid=652&amp;amp;language=english&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;(About Kids Health)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
About &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/06/23/877543610/a-year-in-1st-patient-to-get-gene-editing-for-sickle-cell-disease-is-thriving&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;two years ago&lt;/a&gt;, a woman called Victoria Gray became the first person to receive an experimental CRISPR treatment for sickle-cell anemia. Her doctors collected blood-producing stem cells from her bone marrow and edited the gene involved in hemoglobin formation found in the DNA they carry. Then they transfused them back. Gray has not needed the regular blood transfusions or hospitalizations her condition previously demanded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yourgenome.org/facts/what-is-crispr-cas9&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Your Genome&lt;/a&gt;, CRISPR-Cas9 currently stands out as the fastest, cheapest and most reliable gene-editing tool. It is important to mention, though, that it is still unlikely for CRISPR-Cas9 to be used routinely in humans anytime soon. Using this tool along with other gene-editing technologies in somatic cells is well-accepted. In contrast, changes made in germ line cells will be passed on from one generation to another, which has significant ethical implications. The most prominent one is the inability to obtain informed consent, as patients affected by gene edits to germ line cells are embryos and future generations. That aside, CRISPR has shown very promising results in the medical field, and it’s clear that this tool holds great potential for curing diseases we’ve at some point labeled “untreatable.” So for now, we’re just going to have to wait and see what the future holds for such a versatile —and controversial— tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Birds do not understand windows. Though humans know there is a pane of glass, birds see a reflection of their surroundings or an inviting habitat, like an empty room. As a result, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://abcbirds.org/glass-collisions/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;American Bird Conservatory&lt;/a&gt; (ABC) reports that about one billion birds die every year due to glass collisions, making them a leading cause of avian death. For most animals, humanity’s worst threat comes in the form of habitat loss. For birds, the very buildings people inhabit can be deadly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Birds light up the skies with their beautiful feathers and enhance the sounds of the city and country alike with their beautiful songs. Birds also play important roles in maintaining the balance of the ecosystems humans depend on. Some birds, like hummingbirds, act as pollinators, fostering life in the form of plants. Others, like vultures, scavenge the remains of life, returning necessary nutrients to the soil. Still others, like orioles, spread the seeds of plants far and wide, ensuring the continued success of the natural world. Nature needs birds to function properly. Since humanity depends on the world’s ecosystems for everything from food to oxygen, humans need birds. Anything that hurts birds eventually hurts people as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new technology promises hope for the feathered friends of the sky. Bird-safe incorporates materials birds can see into the design of the glass in order to prevent birds from flying into it. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.audubon.org/news/what-does-bird-safe-glass-even-mean&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;National Audubon Society&lt;/a&gt; reports that bird-safe glass is a blanket term, applying to both specially-designed glass and retrofitted glass. Bird-safe glass can be colored, like the glass at the Public Health Office in Palma de Mallorca, Spain (shown above), or it can be virtually transparent, utilizing small dots or lines as a way to alert birds of its presence. The process of retrofitting glass to make it safe for birds often involves adding lines or dots to the surface of the glass. Bird-safe glass and retrofitting buildings can be costly, but in the long run, it can also be beneficial. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://abcbirds.org/glass-collisions/architecture-planning/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ABC&lt;/a&gt; reports the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center near Times Square in Manhattan used to be notorious for the number of bird collisions it caused. However, when bird-safe glass was installed, both bird collisions and heat loss declined. The building went from being an ecological issue to being a model for bird safety and energy efficiency. Bird-safe glass does not only benefit birds; it can benefit its owners as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Codes and ordinances that require new edifices to be built with bird-safe glass are beginning to become common in the United States. New York City, which sees the most yearly bird deaths due to glass collisions, &lt;a href=&quot;https://council.nyc.gov/press/2019/12/10/1847/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;passed a law in 2020&lt;/a&gt; mandating that all new structures meet certain standards of bird safety. A majority of these standards involve glass design. The grassroots organization &lt;a href=&quot;https://birdfriendlychicago.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bird Friendly Chicago&lt;/a&gt; worked for years to introduce bird-safe glass laws to the third most populous city in the United States. They found success in 2019, when a bird-safe glass ordinance was introduced to the Chicago City Council, and again in 2020 when the city council updated Chicago’s Sustainable Development Policy to include information regarding bird-safe glass and its importance. In August of 2020, the city council of Madison, Wisconsin &lt;a href=&quot;https://abcbirds.org/article/madison-bird-friendly-building-ordinance-passed/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;passed an ordinance&lt;/a&gt; requiring bird-safe glass on all new large construction projects. The efforts of committed advocates and the support of the ABC lead to a new rule promising safer skies for Wisconsin’s faster-growing city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, an organization in Madison &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ibmadison.com/city-sued-over-bird-safe-glass-requirement/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;has taken the city to court&lt;/a&gt;, saying that the new ordinance is unconstitutional. Building codes are updated often, and many new construction ordinances are introduced every year, so the chance of the law being nullified is low. However, the general public’s poor understanding of the importance and benefits of bird-safe glass still remains a threat to protective legislation. Many people who are against laws requiring the specialized glass point at the price, which is often elevated, as reasoning for their opinion. However, like in the case of the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, bird-safe glass often leads to lower heating and cooling bills. And either way, the loss of bird life comes with a much higher price tag, both in economic and ecological terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only do birds collide with the windows of large buildings, but they also collide with the windows of ordinary houses. In most areas, glass retrofitting services are not available for homeowners. Luckily, there is a simple solution. Putting stickers, curtains, sheets, or posters can help birds avoid flying into the glass. Protecting birds from glass can provide practical benefits as well! Stickers and posters can be great decorations for a living space, and putting fabric in windows often helps keep a room cooler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many organizations of all sizes are fighting for a safer future for birds. Local organizations all over the world have had success encouraging the passing of legislation that mandates bird-safe glass in certain construction projects. National organizations like the ABC and Audubon support these grassroots movements and push for federal legislation. By passing laws that make buildings safer for birds with the help of organizations like these, humanity can move forward in a responsible and more sustainable manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Chances are, you’ve watched “The Polar Express”. If so, do you remember the bright colorful ribbons in the dark sky? In case you’re not familiar with “The Polar Express”, have you ever seen a picture of a prismatic ribbon across a night sky, specifically in areas where it’s cold? Well, those lights are called auroras.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Auroras, or polar lights, are a natural phenomenon characterized by a display of colored light in the sky. This event is caused by a process involving solar wind. Solar wind is the outward expansion of plasma from the sun. The plasma is heated to the extent that the sun’s gravity cannot hold it in anymore. This solar wind then travels the Earth and enters its magnetic field before reaching the ionosphere, the layer of the atmosphere that contains the highest concentration of ions and free electrons. The energy that is released as a result of this collision creates the spectral wonder around the Northern and Southern poles: an aurora. Because auroras can only be visible at the Northern and Southern poles, they are unique and seeing them is often a once-in-a-lifetime experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Auroras have many different names, other than polar lights. In the Northern pole, they can be called northern lights, and in the Southern pole, they are often called southern lights. The scientific name of auroras is aurora borealis. Aurora comes from the Latin word for “dawn,” as well as the goddess of dawn in Roman mythology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What causes the colors and patterns of auroras? There are various types of ions and atoms that collide with the atmosphere, resulting in a variety of patterns. The forms resulted from this variety can include ripples, “pulsating globs” and steady glows. The altitude affects the colors of the auroras, known as the aurora’s spectrum. This is because the particles from outer space collide with different gasses at different heights, resulting in different colors. Blue, violet and red colors are produced below 60 miles, and bright green between 60 and 150 miles. Above 150 miles, ruby red colors are seen. There is an infinite variety of shapes, colors, brightness and rays an aurora can form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The magic of auroras is only visible at specific times. Auroras are always there, but they’re not as visible at certain times. In some places, such as Abisko, auroras are visible for almost 24 hours a day during winter. In other places, it’s rarer. Of course, auroras are only limited to viewing in the Northern and Southern poles. Darkness is vital for auroras to be visible, and they can be seen from late August to early April when the sky satisfies this condition. There are also aurora forecasts for people enthusiastic about seeing the spectacle for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the beauty of auroras comes with a price. Auroras can actually be potentially &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.suntrek.org/sun-earth-connection/the-aurora/aurorae-effect-us.shtml&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1617439859423000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw2_KP9t2Wj0Shn3r--3H6oG&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;dangerous&lt;/a&gt; to the atmosphere. To make a point clear, they have absolutely no negative impact on humans watching from below whatsoever, but the technology and buildings at a higher elevation can be affected by the electrically charged particles that auroras cause. Auroras disturb the atmosphere that they reside in. They can also disrupt communication from radios, signals and so on. The magnetic energy released by solar wind can blow out electricity. When auroras are active, the Earth’s atmosphere expands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Auroras are beautiful and amazing, despite their negative factors. It’s quite an interesting phenomenon with interesting facts! Although they exist in the sky, sometimes they can come relatively close to the surface of the earth. Did you know that the closest the northern lights have ever come to Earth is 80 kilometers above the surface? To give a little visual aid, 80 kilometers is roughly 50 miles, whereas the atmosphere is 6,214 miles up. Did you know that the International Space Station (ISS) is at the same altitude as the auroras, so they can see the auroras from the side? Multiple planets have auroras, including Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. Southern lights aren’t nearly as popular as northern lights, although they’re nearly the same, because the areas that feature southern lights don’t have much landmass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, auroras are colorful illusions that are created when the sun’s rays hit the Earth’s ionosphere. They come in a variety of shapes and sizes and can be viewed in the Northern and Southern poles. There are different names for auroras, whether it’s specified by the pole it’s in, or its scientific name. In a way, they can have a negative impact on the atmosphere. Now that you know a little more about auroras, maybe one day, you’ll be among the group of people who love them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Whether we go outside or just look through the window, chances are we see trees. Trees take in carbon dioxide and release oxygen around the world, giving us clean air. But are trees just there, existing? Research shows that trees have (some) feelings of their own and have quite a few human characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thought of trees having human characteristics is quite surprising and for good reason. Trees have feelings? That’s crazy! But human characteristics aren’t the limit to what trees can do. In fact, research shows that trees can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21528791-800-plant-senses-sight/#:~:text=The%20obvious%20answer%20is%20that,ultraviolet%20parts%20of%20the%20spectrum.&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;see&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/the-whispering-trees-180968084/#:~:text=They%20don%27t%20have%20nervous,signals%20like%20wounded%20human%20tissue.%E2%80%9D&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;feel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.livescience.com/plants-squeal-when-stressed.html#:~:text=In%20times%20of%20intense%20stress,research%2C%20which%20was%20posted%20Dec.&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;scream&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://english.mathrubhumi.com/news/columns/faunaforum/trees-do-cry--1.244317#:~:text=02%20AM%20IST-,Do%20trees%20cry%3F,to%20hear%2C%20it%20goes%20unheard.&amp;amp;text=Inside%20tree%20trunks%20are%20bundles,the%20highest%20leaves%20and%20branches.&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;cry&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with the basics. Trees are grown plants, with parts including a trunk, branches, leaves and roots. They, like us, require water and basic needs. A tree takes in water, sunlight and carbon dioxide through a process known as photosynthesis. This process produces glucose, or sugar, which the tree uses for energy, and oxygen as a byproduct (humans then breathe in oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide for the tree to use, continuing the cycle).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trees play a big role in our everyday lives at the cost of their own lives (which could span for hundreds or even thousands of years if left undisturbed) because they are used to create paper, furniture, lumber and so much more. However, they prove more useful while they live by cleaning our air and supplying us with many other benefits such as cleaning the environment. Some trees even produce fruit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But do trees have feelings? Trees lack a nervous system, so they can’t experience emotions that we feel, like happiness or excitement. Even though trees lack a brain, the fact that electric signals can be fired from within the trees hints at consciousness. Botanist author &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pri.org/stories/2014-01-09/new-research-plant-intelligence-may-forever-change-how-you-think-about-plants#:~:text=Pollan%20says%20plants%20have%20all,he%20says%2C%20to%20avoid%20obstacles.&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Michael Pollan&lt;/a&gt; explains that they may have a system that produces neurotransmitters, like serotonin, that the human brain also produces. In addition to this, it has been proved that trees do feel a few emotions. Although they don’t experience feelings while being chopped down, they do not like it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The emotional range of a tree is somewhat limited, but that doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist. For instance, they can sense and react to cold, heat, drought, touch and external trouble. When a plant feels that it is too cold, it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lyndontreecare.com/educate/2017/1/28/how-do-trees-survive-winter#:~:text=This%20dormancy%20is%20what%20allows,with%20the%20loss%20of%20leaves.&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;initiates responses&lt;/a&gt; that can help to protect the tree from harm. Trees use their bark to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bioinspiration.net/post/bark-of-trees#:~:text=Bark%20of%20trees%20have%20a,between%206%20and%2010%20microns.&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;reflect light and disperse heat&lt;/a&gt;. To protect themselves from heat, they use their leaves to shade themselves, as well as use &lt;a href=&quot;https://spatialexperiments.wordpress.com/2016/02/08/coping-with-the-heat-trees/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;conductive and insulative cooling&lt;/a&gt;. They sense drought when they do not have enough water to meet their needs, the equivalent of us being thirsty. In this case, they save water and slow down evaporation. In general, plants can feel touch, but it is debated if being touched is beneficial or harmful for the plant. Some studies even show that touch results in stunted growth of the plant. Trees can even sense insects and internally mix chemicals to create compounds that act as repellants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most human responses that trees can feel are rather sad. This includes trees &lt;a href=&quot;https://english.mathrubhumi.com/news/columns/faunaforum/trees-do-cry--1.244317#:~:text=02%20AM%20IST-,Do%20trees%20cry%3F,to%20hear%2C%20it%20goes%20unheard.&amp;amp;text=Inside%20tree%20trunks%20are%20bundles,the%20highest%20leaves%20and%20branches.&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;crying&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.livescience.com/plants-squeal-when-stressed.html%23:~:text%3DIn%2520times%2520of%2520intense%2520stress,research%252C%2520which%2520was%2520posted%2520Dec.&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1617439122668000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw1wb0Gj7etCY8AZW2sBMSLQ&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;screaming&lt;/a&gt; (when they are cut down). The “tears of trees” can have a double meaning: the liquid tears of a tree or the wailing of the tree. The liquid is produced through a process known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.topperlearning.com/answer/why-negative-root-pressure-develops-due-to-excessive-transpiration/d04llzhh%23:~:text%3DRoot%2520pressure%2520is%2520the%2520positive,of%2520nutrients%2520from%2520the%2520soil.%26text%3DThis%2520creates%2520a%2520negative%2520pressure,the%2520roots%252C%2520through%2520the%2520stem.&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1617439274558000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw2bD6a3IfP__AuR0iquYh-N&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;positive root pressure&lt;/a&gt;, where the roots take up water to the limbs of the trees in warm weather so that the buds can break. The wailing of the tree is what occurs when the tree is thirsty. When trees lack water, they suffer and make a noise. The noise, however, is ultrasonic, meaning that it is too high-pitched for the human ear to possibly pick up. Trees will also produce ultrasonic noises between 20 and 100 kilohertz when they’re in pain or when they’re scared, such as when they are being cut down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trees, of course, do not have eyes, ears, a mouth or any other means to communicate. But trees can actually &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21528791-800-plant-senses-sight/#:~:text=The%20obvious%20answer%20is%20that,ultraviolet%20parts%20of%20the%20spectrum.&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;see&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://now.northropgrumman.com/can-plants-hear-the-science-of-sound-sensing-flora/#:~:text=Shhhhhh.,More%20importantly%2C%20they%20can%20react.&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;hear&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cannagardening.com/how_plants_communicate#:~:text=Plants%20taste%20and%20smell%20as,far%20away%20other%20plants%20are.&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;taste&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/the-whispering-trees-180968084/#:~:text=To%20communicate%20through%20the%20network,are%20just%20beginning%20to%20decipher.&amp;amp;text=Trees%20also%20communicate%20through%20the,pheromones%20and%20other%20scent%20signals.&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;communicate&lt;/a&gt;. The sight of a plant may exist because they grow towards areas with light, meaning that they can sense the light with their leaves. Plants can also hear to the degree that they can even respond to human voices. Trees use their roots to absorb nutrients and to taste. They also have a wide arsenal of ways to communicate with one another, including sending chemical, hormonal and slow-pulsing electrical signals and communicating through the air using scent. Trees even have senses that we lack, such as being able to sense &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pri.org/stories/2014-01-09/new-research-plant-intelligence-may-forever-change-how-you-think-about-plants&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;gravitational changes, the presence of water or even a block in their roots&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a way, the needs of a tree are similar to that of a human. Trees need water, food and air. In contrast to humans needing water to use their bodies and excrete waste, trees need water to make their food. As stated, trees use water, sunlight and carbon dioxide to create oxygen and glucose using the equation 6CO2 + 6H2O → C6H12O6 + 6O2 where 6 carbon dioxide molecules and 6 water molecules along with sunlight produce glucose (C6H12O6) and 6 oxygen atoms as a waste product. Unlike us, the tree basically inhales carbon dioxide and exhales oxygen, while we inhale oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide. Trees drink water through a natural straw known as their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/science/xylem&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;xylem&lt;/a&gt;, which brings water to their utmost branches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The anatomy of a tree is similar to human anatomy as well. The arms of a human can be like the branches of a tree. Trees have tree sap that transports nutrients and water through the tree, very much like how blood transports nutrients and water to our entire body. The bronchi in our lungs are also similar to the roots of trees. The leaves of a tree, aside from producing glucose, work as hair for the tree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a recap, trees do not have all human characteristics. In fact, the emotional range of a tree is limited. They may feel pain, but they do not feel regret, happiness, or anything of that sort. However, they do cry and scream, and although seemingly lack the ability to, can see, hear, feel and communicate. Trees have the needs and anatomy of humans in some ways. Globally, trees have many useful aspects such as improving water and air quality, boosting peoples’ health, keeping global warming in check and so much more. Keeping all this in mind, along with the fact that trees are in some ways similar to us, we should love trees more before they’re gone forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;This image of a brain on fire depicts the inflammatory symptoms of this autoimmune disease.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://lions-talk-science.org/2014/05/07/brain-attacks-what-happens-when-the-immune-system-targets-the-brain/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;(Lion Talks Science)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Imagine being a journalist juggling several articles, conducting multiple interviews, learning intensely and more, just to have your life turned completely upside down in a matter of months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/23/books/review/brain-on-fire-by-susannah-cahalan.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Susannah Cahalan&lt;/a&gt;, a 24-year-old reporter for the New York Post, knows what it’s like to be in that situation. She started to experience numbness, paranoia, light sensitivity and abnormal behavior in 2009. Seizures, hallucinations, increasingly erratic actions and even catatonia started to plague her. Her symptoms alarmed her relatives and perplexed several doctors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“An interesting case” is something you don’t want to be to your doctor. Cahalan had the misfortune of becoming a one-of-a-kind and perplexing case: she was gravely ill and rapidly deteriorating, but her MRIs, brain scans and blood tests were all fine. She took $1 million worth of blood tests and brain scans that were inconclusive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grandiosity, hysteria, fits of irrational anger, nonsensical utterances and flat catatonic-like effect were among the signs of the condition, which were mostly indistinguishable from one another throughout their early stages. There were also seizures with “blood and foam” spurting from Cahalan’s mouth, indicating a neurological condition rather than mental illness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cahalan was seen by Dr. Souhel Najjar, a Syrian-American neurologist, after a month in the hospital. He asked her to draw a clock on a piece of paper. She drew the circles and the numbers one to 12 all on the right-hand side of the clock, but the left-hand side was blank. It revealed that she had left-side spatial neglect and that the right side of her brain, which controls her left field of vision, was inflamed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Najjar simply told her parents that her brain was on fire. This observation led to her getting diagnosed with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-NMDA_receptor_encephalitis#:~:text=Anti%2DNMDA%20receptor%20encephalitis%20is,%2C%20headache%2C%20and%20feeling%20tired.&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis&lt;/a&gt;, a very rare autoimmune disease that is almost undocumented in the medical literature. Dr. Josep Dalmau and colleagues at the University of Pennsylvania first discovered anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The disorder was portrayed in the 2016 Netflix film &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZn6G0M9wNs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Brain on Fire&lt;/a&gt; in which Susannah Cahalan was played by Chloe Grace Moretz. This film was based on Susannah’s book called “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_on_Fire&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Brain on Fire: My Month of Madness&lt;/a&gt;” after chronicling her experience in a 2009 New York Post report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;Above is the movie poster for Netflix’s film “Brain On Fire”.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netflix.com/title/80128245&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;(Netflix)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Anti-NMDAR encephalitis induces confusion, memory loss and seizures, which are often accompanied by altered consciousness and changes in blood pressure, heart rate and temperature, as portrayed in the film. The film’s graphic depictions of these symptoms – hallucinations, delusions and aggression – shocked audiences, but were true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The entire event (in the hospital) lasted one month, but Susannah has no recollection of what happened to her, except for sporadic, almost hallucinatory flashbacks, such as being strapped to her hospital bed as a “flight risk.” Her only knowledge of what had happened to her and her behavior came from a journal kept by her father, mother and boyfriend when they were watching over her in the hospital. After her diagnosis, Susannah was quickly on the mend, and after several months, she was able to return to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Young women like Susannah are the majority of those who experience anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis. The average age is 20 years old. Since people’s behavioral changes can be very drastic, it’s not uncommon for them to be admitted to a psychiatric facility first. Physicians usually know the issue isn’t mental when neurological signs occur, such as seizures or a lack of responsiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearly every neuron in the brain contains NMDA receptors. These receptors are necessary for the development of new memories in the hippocampus of humans and animals, and have been linked to several neurological and psychiatric disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease, schizophrenia and depression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Antibodies are components of the immune system that protect the body from infection and illness. They respond with proteins in the body when they don’t function properly, resulting in an autoimmune disorder. Autoimmune encephalitis is a condition in which the body reacts to proteins in the brain. An assault on the NMDA receptor, one of the most important neurotransmitter receptors in the brain, prompts the adverse side effects that come with the condition. Intellectual changes, extreme memory loss, seizures and even death are all symptoms of the disorder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis manifests itself in a variety of ways, with varying degrees of severity. Patients usually begin with milder symptoms and quickly progress to a condition that necessitates hospitalization. Clinical signs are often used to diagnose anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis. The diagnosis is validated by analyzing the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) or blood serum in the lab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The medication for this condition varies by patient but usually involves a combination of first and second-line treatments. The first-line treatment consists of tumor removal (if present), steroids, plasma exchange (plasmapheresis) and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). The second-line treatment is generally &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-4067-2108/cellcept-oral/mycophenolate-mofetil-oral/details&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CellCept&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medicinenet.com/rituximab/article.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Rituximab&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rxlist.com/cytoxan-drug.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Cytoxan&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recovery is gradual and usually happens in the same order as the onset of symptoms. The most serious symptoms usually go away first, although cognitive, behavioral and memory issues take longer. Within two years of onset, the majority of patients will be completely recovered. The prompt diagnosis and aggressive treatment, including second-line therapies, are all predictors of positive outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if we do not know the exact cause of this disease, we can hope for significant advances in this field of study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ve probably heard of Pangaea, the enormous supercontinent that formed 300 million years ago and broke apart into the continents we know today. But did you know scientists believe that a total of seven supercontinents have formed over the course of Earth’s history?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://earthobservatory.sg/faq-on-earth-sciences/what-supercontinent&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Supercontinents&lt;/a&gt; are single connected continents made up of all or most of the land on the surface of Earth. Plate tectonics under these landmasses float on the molten mantle under the Earth’s crust, slowly pushing continents together and breaking them apart. The plates are moved over long periods of time by changes in temperature, intensity or direction in the flow of the mantle. This results in new supercontinents forming and splitting up about every 400 to 500 million years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But why do supercontinents matter? Plate tectonics move so slowly, about three to five centimeters a year, that their changes are hardly noticeable to humans. In fact, they are so hard to detect that the theory of continental drift wasn’t proposed until the 20th century, and still wasn’t accepted until the 1960s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, we now know that over billions of years, continental drift has shaped &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfYn9KVya-Q&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;almost every aspect of the Earth&lt;/a&gt; as we know it. Extinction events and climate changes are closely tied to plate tectonics. For example, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cosmosmagazine.com/earth/earth-sciences/tectonic-timelapse/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Snowball Earth&lt;/a&gt; theory hypothesizes that two ice ages about 720 million years ago were caused by erosion of mountain ranges that pushed nutrients into the sea, resulting in an explosion of oxygen-producing bacteria. This drastic change in Earth’s atmosphere would have had many effects on the climate, and eventually led to the surface of the Earth becoming covered in glaciers, as well as one of the planet’s earliest mass extinctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even after the possibility of supercontinents was accepted, it was nearly impossible to find evidence of the supercontinents before Pangaea. Since &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.livescience.com/43220-subduction-zone-definition.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;subduction&lt;/a&gt; (the movement of plates under each other and into the mantle) and seafloor melt replace plate tectonic material, nearly all of the land that makes up the Earth’s crust is less than 200 million years old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, thanks to research into the mineral distribution and carbon dating, we can piece together what past supercontinents might have looked like, how they formed and how they broke apart. Although all models of early Earth’s plate tectonics are very theoretical, scientists can generally agree that there have been a total of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.the-dialogue.com/en/en33-earths-supercontinents/&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1616228929288000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw25c5VGA4_JEWNLTPmFwbRR&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;seven supercontinents&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first and earliest supercontinent to have existed is the most theoretical. The supercontinent Vaalbara is suspected to have formed 3.6 billion years ago from the Kaapvaal and Pilbara &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/science/craton&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;cratons&lt;/a&gt; (stable blocks of Earth’s crust that form the center of a continent). These cratons can now be found in South Africa and Western Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The supercontinent Ur, its name meaning “original” in German, formed shortly after Vaalbara from the same cratons approximately 3 billion years ago. The specifics of this continent are also very theoretical, and despite its supercontinent status, the land mass would have been smaller than modern-day Australia. Ur remained intact as a part of other supercontinents until Pangaea split apart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 300 million years after Ur’s formation, the supercontinent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thearmchairexplorer.com/geology/kenorland.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kenorlan&lt;/a&gt; came together from the merging of Vaalbara and the newly formed continental crust along the planet’s equator. At this time, eukaryotic organisms were emerging in the world’s oceans. As the supercontinent split apart, geologic events and the rise of oxygen-producing, single-celled life created the conditions for the Earth’s first glaciers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next supercontinent only existed for a short while: Colombia, also called Nuna or Hudsonland, formed about 1.8 billion years ago and broke up 1.5 billion years ago. During this time, the first plants colonized land in the form of red algae.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the time of the rise of the next supercontinent, &lt;a href=&quot;https://carnegiescience.edu/news/one-supercontinents-different-others-it%E2%80%99s-rodinia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Rodinia&lt;/a&gt;, 1.1 billion years ago, the Earth’s landmasses began to loosely resemble our current continents. Differently from most other supercontinents, Rodinia formed from two-sided subduction, where both tectonic plates involved are pushed down into the mantle, rather than just one. Unfortunately, this means the supercontinent’s formation did not involve much volcanic activity, leaving less preserved mineral evidence of the event. However, we do know that during Rodinia’s existence, the first multicellular organisms began to appear in oceans around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 100 million years after Rodinia split in two, the supercontinent, Pannotia came together while most land was located at the Earth’s poles in glacier form. Two oceans, the Panthalassa and Pan-African, formed and later merged into one. Pannotia eventually split apart into four pieces: Gondwana, Baltica, Siberia and Laurentia. &lt;a href=&quot;http://earthguide.ucsd.edu/eoc/teachers/t_tectonics/p_pangaea2.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Gondwana&lt;/a&gt; is sometimes considered its own supercontinent due to its large size, but it was not connected to the three other fairly large continents of the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the formation of Pangaea, life began to make its way from the ocean onto land. So, when the continents came together, these diverse forms of life which had evolved separately for over 100 million years were introduced to each other and began to spread and adapt to their new environments. The collision of the northern half, Laurasia, and southern half, Gondwana, also created many of the mountain ranges we see on our planet today. The end of Pangaea saw the rise of the dinosaurs. As landmasses drifted apart, species were separated and quickly evolved to adapt to their new, respective continents. By the time they came back together or were reconnected via land bridges, the dinosaurs would be long extinct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Pangaea, the landmasses of Eurasia and North America would form from the Northern half, and Africa, South America, India, Australia and Antarctica would form from the Southern half. In the meantime, a continuous ocean ran across the entire equator, producing a very different global landscape than what we have today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of research into past supercontinents and plate tectonics, we can guess what our planet could look like someday in the distant future. Three such theories of how the next supercontinent will come together are the Pangaea Ultima, Amasia and Novopangaea theories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2000/ast06oct_1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Pangaea Ultima&lt;/a&gt; theory is the most commonly mentioned. In this scenario, Africa and Australia will continue their northward courses until they smash into Europe and Asia. Over millions of years, the Atlantic Ocean will widen, creating a new underwater mountain range down its center, until the Americas come full circle and collide with the Euro-African continent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Amasia supercontinent theory is similar to Pangaea Ultima as it also involves the expansion of the Atlantic, but it instead predicts that the continents will join together as they move to the North Pole. The Novopangaea theory is based on this idea but predicts Australia and Antarctica will join where the Pacific Ocean is today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study of past supercontinents and plate tectonics gives us insight into the inner workings of the Earth. Our planet is larger and older than we can comprehend, with more history than we can hope to learn. Understanding how it has changed can shed light on valuable information about almost every aspect of the Earth and the creatures that have lived on it, showing us how far we’ve come and where we might be headed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogs/2021/march/brainOne.png&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin: 0 auto&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;Above is a graphic that explains some of the advantages of a bilingual brain in children, such as improving the ability to solve problems and making decisions. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.figur8.net/2018/11/15/the-truth-about-the-bilingual-brain/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;(Nature for the Future)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many people all over the world who can speak more than one language, either out of necessity or simply by choice. Being bilingual can offer so much more than simply the ability to communicate with more people. For example, it can improve brain function and slow down the effects of aging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How does being bilingual affect brain structure?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being bilingual can &lt;a href=&quot;https://knowablemagazine.org/article/mind/2018/how-second-language-can-boost-brain#:~:text=As%20bilingual%20individuals%20age%2C%20their,monolingual%20people%2C%20enhancing%20cognitive%20reserve.&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;improve one’s executive function&lt;/a&gt;, which is one’s ability to plan, coordinate attention and avoid distractions. This is because the area of the brain that is used to regulate two languages is also used when performing tasks while filtering out distractions. In general, the bilingual brain has greater gray matter (the cell bodies and dendrites in our neurons). Gray matter is connected to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.beingpatient.com/improve-grey-matter-brain-cardio-exercise/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;memory, decision-making, speech&lt;/a&gt;, etc., making gray matter associated with the health of the brain. Additionally, the bilingual brain has stronger neural connections, and its white matter (the axons of the neurons) suffers less damage, which means the communication between neurons is quicker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/319642&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Professor Viorica Marian&lt;/a&gt; from Northwestern University conducted a study that revealed that more areas of the brain, specifically the frontal and subcortical areas, were affected in a bilingual person than a monolingual person when they heard similar sounding things. A monolingual brain tends to only think of words in that language while bilinguals have to use more parts of the brain to differentiate between similar sounding words from two different languages. This points to greater neural plasticity, which is the ability of our nervous system to adjust to environmental changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bilingual brain also experiences the effects of aging at a slower rate. For one, degradation of white matter is associated with aging, and as stated above, the white matter in a bilingual brain experiences less damage. Being able to coordinate attention to different tasks while avoiding distractions also gives bilinguals an advantage because the inability to control attention is connected to the loss of cognitive function as we age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How does being bilingual affect children?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some common misconceptions when it comes to being bilingual that need to be addressed. First, if a child learns two languages together, it will not confuse them or hinder their development. In fact, cognitive flexibility (the ability to switch between different tasks or ideas) in a child’s brain will increase because their cognitive muscles need to work hard to switch from one language to another. Children frequently do this when speaking to different family members, and this can later be applied to other everyday tasks. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.canr.msu.edu/news/advantages_of_a_bilingual_brain&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;results of a 2004 study&lt;/a&gt; conducted by psychologists Ellen Bialystok and Michelle Martin-Rhee highlight that bilingual children could separate objects based on their shape and color more easily than monolingual children which points to a higher functioning command center in the brain of bilingual children. The command center of the brain controls problem-solving and execution of difficult cognitive tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, another widely held belief is that children learn a second language faster than adults, but whether or not that is true is still an ongoing debate. Children can pick up the basics of a language faster than adults because their brains can &lt;a href=&quot;https://tessais.org/children-learn-languages-faster-adults/#:~:text=Later%20in%20life%2C%20those%20neural,languages%20at%20a%20faster%20rate&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;create neural connections at a much higher rate&lt;/a&gt;. As a result, they have greater brain plasticity. Another area that children excel at is pronunciation because they have &lt;a href=&quot;https://wp.dinolingo.com/articles/do-children-learn-languages-faster-than-adults/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;greater neuromuscular control&lt;/a&gt;, as their brains are not used to any phonetics yet, making it easier for them to create new sounds. However, when it comes to mastery of a second language, adults are still superior because children are unable to comprehend things such as verb tenses and sentence structure while the adults are bound to focus on those skills when they actively study a second language. Children will pick up vocabulary from their family members without even realizing they are learning something, making their language skills more elementary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many scientists use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2019/11/do-kids-really-learn-languages-faster-than-adults/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Critical Period hypothesis&lt;/a&gt;, by Wilder Penfield and Lamar Roberts, to argue that learning a second language is faster for children. The hypothesis states that there is a critical period of time, which ends when a person reaches puberty, for language learning, but this is only true for a first language. Many &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tradiling.net/a-critical-period-to-learn-a-second-language/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;studies have shown&lt;/a&gt; that the critical period differs based on the category of language learning such as phonology or syntax, and there is no sudden change in our ability to learn a second language right after puberty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are still so many questions unanswered about the bilingual brain. What other differences are there between a bilingual brain and a monolingual brain that we have yet to discover? Why do the same rules not apply to learning a first and second language for children? Despite all of these mysteries that remain unsolved, there are several benefits to learning a second language that have already been proven for both adults and children. So even if it might seem unfathomable with most of our busy schedules, try setting aside 10 minutes a day, open up Duolingo, start learning some basic vocabulary and go from there.&lt;/p&gt;
