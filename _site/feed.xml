&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;This image of a brain on fire depicts the inflammatory symptoms of this autoimmune disease.

&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Imagine being a journalist juggling several articles, conducting multiple interviews, learning intensely and more, just to have your life turned completely upside down in a matter of months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/23/books/review/brain-on-fire-by-susannah-cahalan.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Susannah Cahalan&lt;/a&gt;, a 24-year-old reporter for the New York Post, knows what it’s like to be in that situation. She started to experience numbness, paranoia, light sensitivity and abnormal behavior in 2009. Seizures, hallucinations, increasingly erratic actions and even catatonia started to plague her. Her symptoms alarmed her relatives and perplexed several doctors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“An interesting case” is something you don’t want to be to your doctor. Cahalan had the misfortune of becoming a one-of-a-kind and perplexing case: she was gravely ill and rapidly deteriorating, but her MRIs, brain scans and blood tests were all fine. She took $1 million worth of blood tests and brain scans that were inconclusive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grandiosity, hysteria, fits of irrational anger, nonsensical utterances and flat catatonic-like effect were among the signs of the condition, which were mostly indistinguishable from one another throughout their early stages. There were also seizures with “blood and foam” spurting from Cahalan’s mouth, indicating a neurological condition rather than mental illness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cahalan was seen by Dr. Souhel Najjar, a Syrian-American neurologist, after a month in the hospital. He asked her to draw a clock on a piece of paper. She drew the circles and the numbers one to 12 all on the right-hand side of the clock, but the left-hand side was blank. It revealed that she had left-side spatial neglect and that the right side of her brain, which controls her left field of vision, was inflamed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Najjar simply told her parents that her brain was on fire. This observation led to her getting diagnosed with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-NMDA_receptor_encephalitis#:~:text=Anti%2DNMDA%20receptor%20encephalitis%20is,%2C%20headache%2C%20and%20feeling%20tired.&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis&lt;/a&gt;, a very rare autoimmune disease that is almost undocumented in the medical literature. Dr. Josep Dalmau and colleagues at the University of Pennsylvania first discovered anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The disorder was portrayed in the 2016 Netflix film &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZn6G0M9wNs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Brain on Fire&lt;/a&gt; in which Susannah Cahalan was played by Chloe Grace Moretz. This film was based on Susannah’s book called “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_on_Fire&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Brain on Fire: My Month of Madness&lt;/a&gt;” after chronicling her experience in a 2009 New York Post report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;Above is the movie poster for Netflix’s film “Brain On Fire”.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netflix.com/title/80128245&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;(Netflix)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Anti-NMDAR encephalitis induces confusion, memory loss and seizures, which are often accompanied by altered consciousness and changes in blood pressure, heart rate and temperature, as portrayed in the film. The film’s graphic depictions of these symptoms – hallucinations, delusions and aggression – shocked audiences, but were true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The entire event (in the hospital) lasted one month, but Susannah has no recollection of what happened to her, except for sporadic, almost hallucinatory flashbacks, such as being strapped to her hospital bed as a “flight risk.” Her only knowledge of what had happened to her and her behavior came from a journal kept by her father, mother and boyfriend when they were watching over her in the hospital. After her diagnosis, Susannah was quickly on the mend, and after several months, she was able to return to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Young women like Susannah are the majority of those who experience anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis. The average age is 20 years old. Since people’s behavioral changes can be very drastic, it’s not uncommon for them to be admitted to a psychiatric facility first. Physicians usually know the issue isn’t mental when neurological signs occur, such as seizures or a lack of responsiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearly every neuron in the brain contains NMDA receptors. These receptors are necessary for the development of new memories in the hippocampus of humans and animals, and have been linked to several neurological and psychiatric disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease, schizophrenia and depression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Antibodies are components of the immune system that protect the body from infection and illness. They respond with proteins in the body when they don’t function properly, resulting in an autoimmune disorder. Autoimmune encephalitis is a condition in which the body reacts to proteins in the brain. An assault on the NMDA receptor, one of the most important neurotransmitter receptors in the brain, prompts the adverse side effects that come with the condition. Intellectual changes, extreme memory loss, seizures and even death are all symptoms of the disorder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis manifests itself in a variety of ways, with varying degrees of severity. Patients usually begin with milder symptoms and quickly progress to a condition that necessitates hospitalization. Clinical signs are often used to diagnose anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis. The diagnosis is validated by analyzing the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) or blood serum in the lab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The medication for this condition varies by patient but usually involves a combination of first and second-line treatments. The first-line treatment consists of tumor removal (if present), steroids, plasma exchange (plasmapheresis) and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). The second-line treatment is generally &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-4067-2108/cellcept-oral/mycophenolate-mofetil-oral/details&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CellCept&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medicinenet.com/rituximab/article.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Rituximab&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rxlist.com/cytoxan-drug.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Cytoxan&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recovery is gradual and usually happens in the same order as the onset of symptoms. The most serious symptoms usually go away first, although cognitive, behavioral and memory issues take longer. Within two years of onset, the majority of patients will be completely recovered. The prompt diagnosis and aggressive treatment, including second-line therapies, are all predictors of positive outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if we do not know the exact cause of this disease, we can hope for significant advances in this field of study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;An artist’s rendition of what the early supercontinent, Ur, might have looked like.
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.the-dialogue.com/en/en33-earths-supercontinents/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;(The Dialogue)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ve probably heard of Pangaea, the enormous supercontinent that formed 300 million years ago and broke apart into the continents we know today. But did you know scientists believe that a total of seven supercontinents have formed over the course of Earth’s history?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://earthobservatory.sg/faq-on-earth-sciences/what-supercontinent&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Supercontinents&lt;/a&gt; are single connected continents made up of all or most of the land on the surface of Earth. Plate tectonics under these landmasses float on the molten mantle under the Earth’s crust, slowly pushing continents together and breaking them apart. The plates are moved over long periods of time by changes in temperature, intensity or direction in the flow of the mantle. This results in new supercontinents forming and splitting up about every 400 to 500 million years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But why do supercontinents matter? Plate tectonics move so slowly, about three to five centimeters a year, that their changes are hardly noticeable to humans. In fact, they are so hard to detect that the theory of continental drift wasn’t proposed until the 20th century, and still wasn’t accepted until the 1960s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, we now know that over billions of years, continental drift has shaped &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfYn9KVya-Q&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;almost every aspect of the Earth&lt;/a&gt; as we know it. Extinction events and climate changes are closely tied to plate tectonics. For example, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cosmosmagazine.com/earth/earth-sciences/tectonic-timelapse/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Snowball Earth&lt;/a&gt; theory hypothesizes that two ice ages about 720 million years ago were caused by erosion of mountain ranges that pushed nutrients into the sea, resulting in an explosion of oxygen-producing bacteria. This drastic change in Earth’s atmosphere would have had many effects on the climate, and eventually led to the surface of the Earth becoming covered in glaciers, as well as one of the planet’s earliest mass extinctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even after the possibility of supercontinents was accepted, it was nearly impossible to find evidence of the supercontinents before Pangaea. Since &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.livescience.com/43220-subduction-zone-definition.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;subduction&lt;/a&gt; (the movement of plates under each other and into the mantle) and seafloor melt replace plate tectonic material, nearly all of the land that makes up the Earth’s crust is less than 200 million years old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, thanks to research into the mineral distribution and carbon dating, we can piece together what past supercontinents might have looked like, how they formed and how they broke apart. Although all models of early Earth’s plate tectonics are very theoretical, scientists can generally agree that there have been a total of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.the-dialogue.com/en/en33-earths-supercontinents/&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1616228929288000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw25c5VGA4_JEWNLTPmFwbRR&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;seven supercontinents&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first and earliest supercontinent to have existed is the most theoretical. The supercontinent Vaalbara is suspected to have formed 3.6 billion years ago from the Kaapvaal and Pilbara &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/science/craton&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;cratons&lt;/a&gt; (stable blocks of Earth’s crust that form the center of a continent). These cratons can now be found in South Africa and Western Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The supercontinent Ur, its name meaning “original” in German, formed shortly after Vaalbara from the same cratons approximately 3 billion years ago. The specifics of this continent are also very theoretical, and despite its supercontinent status, the land mass would have been smaller than modern-day Australia. Ur remained intact as a part of other supercontinents until Pangaea split apart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 300 million years after Ur’s formation, the supercontinent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thearmchairexplorer.com/geology/kenorland.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kenorlan&lt;/a&gt; came together from the merging of Vaalbara and the newly formed continental crust along the planet’s equator. At this time, eukaryotic organisms were emerging in the world’s oceans. As the supercontinent split apart, geologic events and the rise of oxygen-producing, single-celled life created the conditions for the Earth’s first glaciers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next supercontinent only existed for a short while: Colombia, also called Nuna or Hudsonland, formed about 1.8 billion years ago and broke up 1.5 billion years ago. During this time, the first plants colonized land in the form of red algae.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the time of the rise of the next supercontinent, &lt;a href=&quot;https://carnegiescience.edu/news/one-supercontinents-different-others-it%E2%80%99s-rodinia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Rodinia&lt;/a&gt;, 1.1 billion years ago, the Earth’s landmasses began to loosely resemble our current continents. Differently from most other supercontinents, Rodinia formed from two-sided subduction, where both tectonic plates involved are pushed down into the mantle, rather than just one. Unfortunately, this means the supercontinent’s formation did not involve much volcanic activity, leaving less preserved mineral evidence of the event. However, we do know that during Rodinia’s existence, the first multicellular organisms began to appear in oceans around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 100 million years after Rodinia split in two, the supercontinent, Pannotia came together while most land was located at the Earth’s poles in glacier form. Two oceans, the Panthalassa and Pan-African, formed and later merged into one. Pannotia eventually split apart into four pieces: Gondwana, Baltica, Siberia and Laurentia. &lt;a href=&quot;http://earthguide.ucsd.edu/eoc/teachers/t_tectonics/p_pangaea2.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Gondwana&lt;/a&gt; is sometimes considered its own supercontinent due to its large size, but it was not connected to the three other fairly large continents of the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the formation of Pangaea, life began to make its way from the ocean onto land. So, when the continents came together, these diverse forms of life which had evolved separately for over 100 million years were introduced to each other and began to spread and adapt to their new environments. The collision of the northern half, Laurasia, and southern half, Gondwana, also created many of the mountain ranges we see on our planet today. The end of Pangaea saw the rise of the dinosaurs. As landmasses drifted apart, species were separated and quickly evolved to adapt to their new, respective continents. By the time they came back together or were reconnected via land bridges, the dinosaurs would be long extinct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Pangaea, the landmasses of Eurasia and North America would form from the Northern half, and Africa, South America, India, Australia and Antarctica would form from the Southern half. In the meantime, a continuous ocean ran across the entire equator, producing a very different global landscape than what we have today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of research into past supercontinents and plate tectonics, we can guess what our planet could look like someday in the distant future. Three such theories of how the next supercontinent will come together are the Pangaea Ultima, Amasia and Novopangaea theories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2000/ast06oct_1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Pangaea Ultima&lt;/a&gt; theory is the most commonly mentioned. In this scenario, Africa and Australia will continue their northward courses until they smash into Europe and Asia. Over millions of years, the Atlantic Ocean will widen, creating a new underwater mountain range down its center, until the Americas come full circle and collide with the Euro-African continent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Amasia supercontinent theory is similar to Pangaea Ultima as it also involves the expansion of the Atlantic, but it instead predicts that the continents will join together as they move to the North Pole. The Novopangaea theory is based on this idea but predicts Australia and Antarctica will join where the Pacific Ocean is today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study of past supercontinents and plate tectonics gives us insight into the inner workings of the Earth. Our planet is larger and older than we can comprehend, with more history than we can hope to learn. Understanding how it has changed can shed light on valuable information about almost every aspect of the Earth and the creatures that have lived on it, showing us how far we’ve come and where we might be headed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogs/2021/march/brainOne.png&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin: 0 auto&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;Above is a graphic that explains some of the advantages of a bilingual brain in children, such as improving the ability to solve problems and making decisions. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.figur8.net/2018/11/15/the-truth-about-the-bilingual-brain/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;(Nature for the Future)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many people all over the world who can speak more than one language, either out of necessity or simply by choice. Being bilingual can offer so much more than simply the ability to communicate with more people. For example, it can improve brain function and slow down the effects of aging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How does being bilingual affect brain structure?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being bilingual can &lt;a href=&quot;https://knowablemagazine.org/article/mind/2018/how-second-language-can-boost-brain#:~:text=As%20bilingual%20individuals%20age%2C%20their,monolingual%20people%2C%20enhancing%20cognitive%20reserve.&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;improve one’s executive function&lt;/a&gt;, which is one’s ability to plan, coordinate attention and avoid distractions. This is because the area of the brain that is used to regulate two languages is also used when performing tasks while filtering out distractions. In general, the bilingual brain has greater gray matter (the cell bodies and dendrites in our neurons). Gray matter is connected to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.beingpatient.com/improve-grey-matter-brain-cardio-exercise/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;memory, decision-making, speech&lt;/a&gt;, etc., making gray matter associated with the health of the brain. Additionally, the bilingual brain has stronger neural connections, and its white matter (the axons of the neurons) suffers less damage, which means the communication between neurons is quicker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/319642&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Professor Viorica Marian&lt;/a&gt; from Northwestern University conducted a study that revealed that more areas of the brain, specifically the frontal and subcortical areas, were affected in a bilingual person than a monolingual person when they heard similar sounding things. A monolingual brain tends to only think of words in that language while bilinguals have to use more parts of the brain to differentiate between similar sounding words from two different languages. This points to greater neural plasticity, which is the ability of our nervous system to adjust to environmental changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bilingual brain also experiences the effects of aging at a slower rate. For one, degradation of white matter is associated with aging, and as stated above, the white matter in a bilingual brain experiences less damage. Being able to coordinate attention to different tasks while avoiding distractions also gives bilinguals an advantage because the inability to control attention is connected to the loss of cognitive function as we age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How does being bilingual affect children?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some common misconceptions when it comes to being bilingual that need to be addressed. First, if a child learns two languages together, it will not confuse them or hinder their development. In fact, cognitive flexibility (the ability to switch between different tasks or ideas) in a child’s brain will increase because their cognitive muscles need to work hard to switch from one language to another. Children frequently do this when speaking to different family members, and this can later be applied to other everyday tasks. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.canr.msu.edu/news/advantages_of_a_bilingual_brain&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;results of a 2004 study&lt;/a&gt; conducted by psychologists Ellen Bialystok and Michelle Martin-Rhee highlight that bilingual children could separate objects based on their shape and color more easily than monolingual children which points to a higher functioning command center in the brain of bilingual children. The command center of the brain controls problem-solving and execution of difficult cognitive tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, another widely held belief is that children learn a second language faster than adults, but whether or not that is true is still an ongoing debate. Children can pick up the basics of a language faster than adults because their brains can &lt;a href=&quot;https://tessais.org/children-learn-languages-faster-adults/#:~:text=Later%20in%20life%2C%20those%20neural,languages%20at%20a%20faster%20rate&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;create neural connections at a much higher rate&lt;/a&gt;. As a result, they have greater brain plasticity. Another area that children excel at is pronunciation because they have &lt;a href=&quot;https://wp.dinolingo.com/articles/do-children-learn-languages-faster-than-adults/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;greater neuromuscular control&lt;/a&gt;, as their brains are not used to any phonetics yet, making it easier for them to create new sounds. However, when it comes to mastery of a second language, adults are still superior because children are unable to comprehend things such as verb tenses and sentence structure while the adults are bound to focus on those skills when they actively study a second language. Children will pick up vocabulary from their family members without even realizing they are learning something, making their language skills more elementary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many scientists use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2019/11/do-kids-really-learn-languages-faster-than-adults/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Critical Period hypothesis&lt;/a&gt;, by Wilder Penfield and Lamar Roberts, to argue that learning a second language is faster for children. The hypothesis states that there is a critical period of time, which ends when a person reaches puberty, for language learning, but this is only true for a first language. Many &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tradiling.net/a-critical-period-to-learn-a-second-language/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;studies have shown&lt;/a&gt; that the critical period differs based on the category of language learning such as phonology or syntax, and there is no sudden change in our ability to learn a second language right after puberty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are still so many questions unanswered about the bilingual brain. What other differences are there between a bilingual brain and a monolingual brain that we have yet to discover? Why do the same rules not apply to learning a first and second language for children? Despite all of these mysteries that remain unsolved, there are several benefits to learning a second language that have already been proven for both adults and children. So even if it might seem unfathomable with most of our busy schedules, try setting aside 10 minutes a day, open up Duolingo, start learning some basic vocabulary and go from there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;The diagram above shows Earth’s effect on spacetime curvature.
&lt;a href=&quot;http://thescienceexplorer.com/universe/how-gravity-changes-time-effect-known-gravitational-time-dilation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;(Science Explorer)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;What is time dilation?&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Einstein’s theory of relativity suggested a new outlook of space-time itself. He described time as modified; rather than time being a constant moving parameter, it moves relative to an object’s path. Time can be warped or changed by high gravitational forces and immense speeds. Essentially, speed and force can alter the fabric of space-time entirely. Timewarp predominantly causes time to slow down or speed up in the observer’s perspective, which is otherwise known as time dilation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Speed and time dilation&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;To understand the effects of time dilation, we need to understand the true nature of light. The reason behind light’s immense speed is the nature of photons. Since photons are massless, outside forces cannot affect the path these particles take. Their massless nature causes not only immense speeds but also instant acceleration. Unlike time itself, light is a constant moving wave, meaning however fast the initial light source is moving, the photons themselves always travel at a constant rate. This speed is also known as the speed of light. Regardless of whether they are emitted from a moving car or a stationary street lamp, the photons all travel at the same speed. On Earth, every second, light travels one light second. Because no feasible mass can travel fully at this speed, let alone an aircraft, let us suppose humanity is, in general constructs, a space carrier capable of achieving speeds that are a large percentage of the speed of light. Since the light on this aircraft, emitted from integrated light sources (such as control panels, inner light bulbs, etc.) can never exceed the speed of light, the photons aboard this high-speed craft travel a greater distance than on a stationary object such as Earth. The light within the aircraft is moving normally, but its journey amplifies due to the craft’s exterior movement. Per every light-second (relative to Earth) onboard the craft, the photons themselves are traveling a light second plus the ship’s velocity. How is this possible? If light always travels at a constant speed, why does one light-second on board the vessel differ from on Earth? This is essentially breaking the laws of physics. To precisely understand how space-time is affected by this inconstant light speed, we need to understand Isaac Newton’s laws of motion and James Clerk Maxwell’s law of electromagnetism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Newton’s laws described the movement as a relative constant, and his equations refer to these magnitudes as “with respect to.” For example, a train is traveling 40 mph with respect to someone at rest. However, it only travels 20 mph with respect to another train traveling 20 mph in the same direction. Now let us imagine the man at rest was watching the train from space. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-fast-is-the-earth-mov/#:~:text=Thus%2C%20the%20surface%20of%20the,or%2067%2C000%20miles%20per%20hour.&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Considering Earth’s orbital speed&lt;/a&gt;, with respect to the man in space, the train moves 67,000 mph. On the other hand, Maxwell found the speed of an electromagnetic wave, such as light, is fixed. It always &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.space.com/15830-light-speed.html#:~:text=The%20speed%20of%20light%20in,7.5%20times%20in%20one%20second.&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;travels at 670,616,629 mph&lt;/a&gt; regardless of who observes it. When faced with inconsistent lightspeed, either Newton’s laws were incomplete and constant speeds did exist, or Maxwell was wrong about light being a universal constant. Einstein realized both laws could coexist by tweaking Newton’s formula. He suggested time itself, for the craft members, must slow down to compensate for the immense speeds such that the magnitude, or one light second, remains constant on both Earth and onboard the ship. Essentially, the closer one travels to the speed of light, the slower time travels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Time dilation thought experiments - The twin experiment&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Since time itself slows down to compensate for light’s uneven magnitude, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-does-relativity-theor/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;processes affected by time also slow down&lt;/a&gt;. To put this into perspective, imagine two identical twin babies are part of this thought experiment. One baby is left on Earth and another is launched in a rocket traveling at 99.999999999 percent (eight zeros) of the speed of light. Abiding by Einstein’s special theory of relativity, the two twins will experience time very differently. Eighty years go by, respective to Earth, and the near lightspeed rocket lands. Both twins are brought into a room. The baby on Earth would have grown into an older man, but the baby on board the rocket would have only aged one day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Time and Dilation&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Space-time is not only affected by speed but also by gravity. As the force of gravity increases, with larger mass objects, its gravitational field grows stronger. Einstein predicted how this &lt;a href=&quot;http://thescienceexplorer.com/universe/how-gravity-changes-time-effect-known-gravitational-time-dilation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;strengthened gravitational field&lt;/a&gt; curves the fabric of space. Since every mass has a gravitational field, any object in the universe affects the fabric of space. Although confusing, we can simulate this curvature with an experiment. By holding a piece of paper by its edges and placing a small weight in the center, we see how the page bends or curves down. The curvature, again, has a direct effect on the light itself. Rather than traveling in a straight path, the light itself must curve with respect to space-time curvature. Imagine two light waves are shined from point A to point B. These points are precisely one light-second apart. One path is directly in a straight line whilst the other is under the influence of gravity. The lightwave taking the straight path will reach point B in exactly one second. Due to the curved path the second light wave must travel, it will take light longer than one second to get to point B. As discussed with dilation speed, time itself must compensate for this uneven light path by slowing down. As time passes slower for the bent lightwave, it can travel further within a shorter period of time, therefore reaching point B in one second. The speed of this light wave does not change, but time does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Applying time dilation to the real world&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Although this concept of relativity dilation seems inapplicable to modern technology, as humanity is not near the development of near light-speed intergalactic travel, the idea of time dilation is still used in daily processes. Satellite communication and projection technology take time dilation into account. Since GPS satellites orbit 12,400 miles away from Earth’s surface at a velocity of 17,000 miles per hour, both their high speeds and weakened gravity slow the time around these satellites. This results in a difference of roughly 38 microseconds between the clocks on Earth and the clocks in space (the space-clocks are ticking at a slower rate). GPS satellites use a hyper-precise clock to determine exact locations on Earth’s surface (more information about GPS location can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ato/service_units/techops/navservices/gnss/gps/howitworks/#:~:text=GPS%20satellites%20carry%20atomic%20clocks,time%20the%20signal%20was%20broadcast.&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). To the naked eye, &lt;a href=&quot;https://physicscentral.com/explore/writers/will.cfm#:~:text=Einstein's%20general%20relativity%20theory%20says,about%2038%20microseconds%20per%20day.&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;38 microseconds&lt;/a&gt; are unnoticeable, but this delay can account for a 6-mile offset for GPS satellites. GPS travel would be much worse than simple unreliability. For example, a six-mile inaccuracy in terms of air travel could potentially be dangerous. Aircraft might be directed away from safe airports, and air traffic control would be nearly impossible. To account for time dilation, satellites’ clocks tick 38 microseconds faster than the clocks on Earth. This allows both clocks to tick at the same rate as the faster-paced clocks cancel the slowed time. So next time you look up and see an aircraft, know that Einstein’s theory of relativity helps it travel safely and accurately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
As opposed to popular belief, music isn’t only used for entertainment, as it has numerous applications in arts and sciences. However, as it turns out, it can take a toll on our physical and psychological well-being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first glance, it may seem surprising, but many people overlook the impact music has had on their lives; instead, they only perceive music as a way of biding their time. A good mixtape is especially important during these times, where everyone is bound to an inactive, home-restricted lifestyle. Starting with its impact on general productivity and mental health to its impact on cardiovascular immunity and neurogenesis, one could argue that music is one of the most effective yet underrated “medicinal drugs” of our time. British neurologist Robert Sacks said it best: “The power of music to integrate and cure is quite fundamental. It is the most profound non-chemical medication.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be it Bruno Mars, Ariana Grande or Juice Wrld, any musical piece you listen to can and will affect your body and mind. Listening to music allows stimulation of &lt;a href=&quot;https://psychcentral.com/news/2018/12/23/music-soothes-anxiety-reduces-pain#1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;specific sensory brain pathways&lt;/a&gt; that decentralize the cognitive focus from other sensory paths responsible for making us feel pain. It creates a positive emotional response and helps reduce pain stimuli by shifting our center of attention from pain to music. So if you are suffering, listen to some tune you enjoy, and it will help you manage the pain. You may find yourself turning to music once again to diminish your levels of stress. &lt;a href=&quot;https://myscena.org/newswire/the-science-behind-why-classical-music-is-good-for-mental-health/#:~:text=Neurologist%20Dr.%20Michael%20Schneck%20found%20that%20classical%20musichelps,26%25%2C%20laughter%20by%2016%25%20and%20relaxation%20by%2011%25.&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Natural sounds, flat musical notes and classical western music&lt;/a&gt; reduce cortisol, a hormone responsible for stress and anxiety, in the body.
Now, whether you are doing homework, studying for a test or working on a project, you will often try to eliminate any distractions, including music, to avoid severe procrastination. However, music does influence the mindset with which we will tackle a task. Yes, you heard it right: listening to your favorite bopping Lady Gaga song will not only motivate you to complete an assignment but also make you more &lt;a href=&quot;https://psychologenie.com/effects-of-music-on-mind-brain#:~:text=%20Effects%20of%20Music%20on%20the%20Mental%20State,of%20learning%20and%20thinking.%20Listening%20to...%20More%20&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;productive and confident&lt;/a&gt;! It will heighten your performance and put a stop to procrastination, which will have a positive effect on your mental health and self-esteem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly enough, music has shown to be quite a factor in fighting certain mental and brain illnesses. When exposed to gentle music, the human brain produces lots of serotonin (a neurotransmitter) the lack of which causes depression. Consequently, relaxing and soothing notes are the weapon of choice in a fight against depression. Moreover, patients that are victims of Alzheimer’s disease and dementia will benefit from musical performances. Their brain cells, the ones that play a role in their memory capacity, will be activated, which would allow the patients to fight the obliviousness brought by their disease. Similarly, &lt;a href=&quot;https://neuro.hms.harvard.edu/centers-and-initiatives/harvard-mahoney-neuroscience-institute/about-hmni/archive-brain-1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;researchers at Harvard&lt;/a&gt; noticed that when people with Parkinson’s disease heard rhythmic music, the brain canals responsible for physical movement dynamized, partially relieving their condition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, music has a remarkable curative effect on the human body. Listening to music can increase the chances of a positive post-surgery outcome. When listening to our favorite melody, our bodies produce endorphins, which speed up the curative process of healing. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22828457/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; shows that working out without a beat will make reaching our full physical potential harder and increases the quantity of oxygen we use. On the other hand, a workout with music in the background allows us to maximize our effectiveness with less oxygen consumption. Listening to music has been shown to reduce &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.healthline.com/health/benefits-of-music#takeaway&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;fatigue&lt;/a&gt;, allowing a longer physical activity, even in patients with cancer. According to the following &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18692321/#:~:text=We%20propose%20that%20listening%20to%20music%20facilitates%20the,of%20steroid%20hormones%2C%20ultimately%20leading%20to%20cerebral%20plasticity.&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, music can even make our brains create more neurons, which leads to cerebral plasticity, an element that affects child and adult development. Listening to music is recommended to people with various diseases, such as the previously mentioned cancer or high blood pressure. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/using-music-to-tune-the-heart&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Patients with heart conditions had their blood pressure lowered and their heart rate slowed down simply from listening to music for 30 minutes&lt;/a&gt;. According to epidemiology professor at &lt;a href=&quot;http://medicine.wvu.edu/News/Story?headline=wvu-innews-uniting-power-of-music-during-isolation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;West Virginia University School of Public Health&lt;/a&gt; Kin Innes, “music seems to selectively activate neurochemical systems and brain structures associated with positive mood, emotion regulation, attention and memory in ways that promote beneficial changes.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Music has come a long way, with its styles changing throughout history frequently. The one thing to remain unfazed about it is that any interaction music ever had with the human ear has resulted in a physical or psychological impact on the human body. It is crucial to remember the effects of music on our healthiness, especially now that everyone is at home, barely going outside, mostly working during the day and watching television or YouTube in the evening. Listening to music while working, during a workout or before going to sleep instead of binge-watching a series would have more beneficial effects on our health. Of course, we won’t stay perfectly fit and healthy just by listening to music now and then, but it would be one of the steps that lead us towards a better, more durable way of living.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;5G has a lot of positive outlooks, but it is also important to consider the potential risks that it poses for our future technologies.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-5g-wireless-technology-and-how-it-works/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;(GeeksForGeeks)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
With COVID-19 cases on the rise and the continuation of quarantine becoming more and more evident, it doesn’t seem like going out and seeing people will become normal anytime soon, so maybe the announcement that an even faster generation of cellular networks is coming out was exciting. However, while many people may see the progression of 5G technology as a good thing, after closer analysis, do the disadvantages outweigh the advantages? Here’s everything you should know about the new 5G technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the past few decades, we have seen many developments in various forms of technology, one of the biggest being what we use to communicate with others every day: cellphones. First came 1G, where we were given the first-ever analog cell phones. Next was 2G where instant messaging and voicemails were debuted. Then, we had 3G where web browsing was improved; we could share images with one another, and we could track our locations. After, we had 4G where the overall smartphone was improved. Each of these advancements was crucial in shaping the technology we have today, so obviously, the release of the most recent and biggest form of cellular networks is a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start off with what 5G is. 5G is the 5th generation of mobile technologies and networks. It is said to have high speeds, becoming much more efficient and effective than 4G. 5G offers a wide range of uses, not just for cell phone users, but for numerous companies in a variety of fields such as medicine, agriculture and artificial intelligence. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/03/business/what-is-5g/index.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt; says it is “expected to change the way people live and work”. It is predicted to give us a great number of advancements that will help shape and change our future. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.qualcomm.com/5g/what-is-5g&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Qualcomm&lt;/a&gt; reports that 5G will have $13.2 trillion of global economic output, create 22.3 million new jobs and grow the GDP by $2.1 trillion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5G has many foreseeable positive outcomes and is expected to help many different fields in advancing their use of technology. In the medical field, 5G’s low latency will help robotic surgeries to become more precise and bring about quicker response times. In addition, hospitals will now be able to exchange high-quality images with one another, allowing doctors to work more collaboratively. Overall, the healthcare field will be able to provide better services through many improvements like advancements in health monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5G also has an outlook on improvements in other fields like agriculture and artificial intelligence. We will be able to see improvements in all sorts of machines ranging from tractors to self-driving cars. 5G has expanded the range of what cellular networks can be used for, and now that we have a better ecosystem of different technologies being brought together, all the different fields can be enhanced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On paper, 5G looks like the best thing that came out of 2020, but there are a number of disadvantages that need to be considered when thinking about how 5G could shape our future. In contrast to the fact that it will provide extremely fast speeds, it will have a questionable range. While the connections are very powerful, they aren’t able to carry across long distances. One cause for this problem is that 5G can often be blocked by large physical objects such as trees and buildings. This disadvantage has caused companies implementing 5G to focus on big cities with dense populations, often leaving out rural areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another major disadvantage is the cost of 5G. Building the towers and structures needed to support 5G does not come cheap, and companies will be investing a high fortune to make this possible. Monetary burdens are not just for the companies providing the services but also for the people looking to use them. 5G is a very powerful network, but to match it, users would need technology capable of handling its networks and connections. With the phones that are currently accessible to the public, a 5G connection would overheat them and drain their battery life. This would mean users would have to replace their old technology, such as phones and computers, with ones that can effectively manage 5G. This offers a great inconvenience to the public because of how expensive, as well as fast-changing, technology can be in today’s world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another risk is security. While 5G is helping to improve things like medical research and military communication services, it is highly important that it is secured. Important networks like 5G can’t be susceptible to data breaches or theft, which is an issue that providers are still battling. Users, whether that be companies or individuals, need to be able to rely on their network, feeling safe that their private information is secured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the advantages and disadvantages of 5G, but it still leaves open the question of whether or not it’s worth giving a shot. Companies like Apple have definitely capitalized off the idea, making it one of their highest selling points for their most recent phone release, the iPhone 12. Further, cellular providers like Verizon have definitely been marketing their usage of 5G as well. As 5G continues to spread, only time will tell whether or not it will come out successful and how it will shape the future of technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Though it is common knowledge that matter is composed of atoms, the way atoms are organized is often overlooked. Crystallography is a branch of science dealing with the arrangement of atoms in crystalline solids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crystallographers determine how atoms are organized by uncovering the properties and structures of the crystals through various techniques, such as X-rays and electron diffraction, the technique of firing electrons at a sample of matter to observe the interference pattern. These properties include the chemical makeup of solids and reveal how they would react to external forces like temperature and salinity. This information is then used by scientists in other fields, including chemistry, biology and physics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a smaller scale, a primary aspect of crystallography is the study of the crystal lattice. A lattice site can be thought of as a representative point; since atoms are arranged symmetrically and at regular intervals, each group of atoms can be represented as a single point. Hence, the entire crystal lattice is a structured arrangement of infinite points with the lattices comprising the outline of the repeating patterns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Geometrically, the arrangement of a crystal lattice is characterized by the intersection of three parallel lines. If you were to separate the lines, there would be three distinct planes—arranging them in a particular manner will result in a 3D network resembling a cube. Each cube is a vital component of the symmetry of a crystal lattice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A common method used by crystallographers is X-ray crystallography. Through this technique, an X-ray beam is diffracted into different directions when it passes through crystalline atoms. Crystallographers measure the angles of the beams to create a three-dimensional model of the electrons’ densities. Electron density is valuable as it allows them to analyze the positions of the atoms, locations of chemical bonds and more. Although X-ray crystallography provides a vast amount of information, it also has shortcomings: the samples of crystals typically need to be placed in an environment that can cause conformational changes or changes to the structure of the crystal. Furthermore, certain crystals are hard to analyze using this method, such as virus particles. Nonetheless, it offers many advantages and has been used extensively in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A notable example of X-ray crystallography is the role it played in the discovery of DNA’s double helix. On May 6, 1952, Rosalind Franklin discovered the three-dimensional structure of DNA, which led to the model created by Watson and Crick. According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://embryo.asu.edu/pages/photograph-51-rosalind-franklin-1952&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Embryo Project Encyclopedia&lt;/a&gt;, “Photograph 51, or Photo 51, revealed information about DNA’s three-dimensional structure by displaying the way a beam of X-rays scattered off a pure fiber of DNA.” As previously mentioned, the diffraction of the beams provides information about a material’s structure. The publication also states, “some biological macromolecules, such as DNA, can form fibers suitable for analysis using X-ray crystallography because their solid forms consist of atoms arranged in a regular pattern.” In other words, not all macromolecules can be analyzed with X-ray crystallography—only those with a regular atom arrangement. This proves to be the case for DNA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recent applications of crystallography include its use in the pharmaceutical industry. X-ray crystallography has served as a key source of data for the development of new drugs. As outlined by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4655606/&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1616231807152000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw2p_-1hDZEmClG2aVW5a7Z_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;National Center for Biotechnology Information&lt;/a&gt; (NCBI), “The remarkable progress in methods for recombinant protein production and crystallization in recent years is in part due to the success of various protein structure and function initiatives.” Protein crystallization is the process of stabilizing protein molecules by crystal contacts. This ultimately allows scientists to see details, such as mutations, in the proteins that are not detectable by even the most powerful light microscopes. The NCBI further describes how recent technological advancements have allowed researchers to apply crystallization more efficiently and have “improv[ed] the probability of crystallization of macromolecules.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A specific example of X-ray crystallography being used for a major development is with regards to insulin, a hormone that regulates blood glucose levels. Since 1926, scientists have been searching for a way to obtain photographs of the crystals in insulin, as described by Dorothy Crowfoot in an article published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/135591a0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt;. The first attempts made by W.H. George were unsuccessful. However, later studies revealed that pepsin, a digestive enzyme, “could give a single X-ray diffraction pattern, suggesting that insulin… could be attacked in the same way if large enough crystals could be grown.” Studies of insulin’s crystallization by D.A. Scott made this possible. By examining its crystal structure, scientists are better able to address some of the problems regarding insulin—too much or too little insulin in the bloodstream interferes with normal glucose levels and is associated with diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, scientists are using crystallography to study the SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus that is responsible for COVID-19. They have already discovered pieces (such as protein molecules) that make up the virus. Evidently, crystallography holds great potential for future research. Understanding the arrangement of atoms within crystalline solids allows for advancements to be made in a variety of scientific fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogs/2021/february/snowflakeOne.jpg&quot; width=&quot;40%&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin: 0 auto&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;Individuals can enjoy crafting their work not only into snowflake shapes, but also as 3D objects pictured above. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sweetpaulmag.com/crafts/lets-make-borax-crystal-ornaments&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;(Sweet Paul)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
With InterSTEM being based in Southern California, many of the volunteers, including myself, suffer from not-so-serious snow deprivation. Reminiscing the idea of frozen crystals falling from the sky, I took it into my own hands to create an alternate winter wonderland, one that anyone, regardless of their geographical location, can experience and enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project is inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sweetpaulmag.com/crafts/lets-make-borax-crystal-ornaments&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Sweet Paul&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ingredients needed&lt;/b&gt;:
  &lt;br /&gt;-Pipe cleaners to shape the designs
  &lt;br /&gt;-Thin metal or wooden sticks
  &lt;br /&gt;-Invisible thread that’ll be used to prop up the finished product (The thinner the material, the less noticeable it’ll be if you’d like to hang up your creations)
  &lt;br /&gt;-Spoons, forks or any other mixing material needed (I recommend that your material is one-time use, as one of the vital ingredients to this craft, borax, can be abrasive to touch.)
  &lt;br /&gt;-Borax (This is a common ingredient used during laundry. If you are doing this craft with kids, please make sure that they do not consume any, as it is toxic.)
  Hot water (It can be room temperature, but the borax dilutes faster in a higher degree liquid.)
  &lt;br /&gt;-Equipment that can be used to heat up substances (microwave or stove)
  &lt;br /&gt;-Tools to measure with (cup, spoons, etc) as all the ingredients need to be added in somewhat exact measurements
  &lt;br /&gt;-A foil or lid to cover the water&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Steps:&lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;1. Get six cups of your water (I will be making a big portion, but please feel free to scale down if you’d like to make less). If you’d like to speed up the borax dissolving process, then put the water in a microwave (in a safe container) or bring your water to a boil.
  &lt;br /&gt;2. Once you have your finished water, add your borax, mixing with a spoon or wooden stick. For six cups of water, I had to use 18-20 tablespoons of borax. Just in case, please wear gloves when handling the powder, and make sure that all children are supervised if participating.
  &lt;br /&gt;3. After adequately mixed (should have an off-white color), go ahead and let the solution sit for 20-50 minutes. If possible, seal the product with a towel or cap.
  &lt;br /&gt;4. Now, grab your pipe cleaner and start shaping it in the shape of your desired crystal. Afterward, get your invisible thread and tie one end of it to the pipe cleaner and the other one to the wooden or metal stick portion.
  &lt;br /&gt;5. Once your water solution is done sitting, you can take the lid off and dip your pipe cleaner into the solution by balancing the stick on the opening of the container. Avoid placing the stick in the crystal solution, but place the pipe cleaner in a position that leaves it steady and stable.
  &lt;br /&gt;6. Cover the container holding your solution with the submerged pipe cleaner inside. Your solution will likely be a rather milky-white color. Go ahead and put your solution in a room-temperature area, allowing the crystals to slowly grow for the next several hours (this shouldn’t take more than a day, but keep an eye on it).
  &lt;br /&gt;7. Over time, the solution should become clearer, and you should be able to see your crystals forming. After they reach a desirable size, go ahead and carefully take the pipe cleaner out. Make sure to dry it on some sort of rack so that it can dry and cool. Your creation will remain fragile as it dries, so make sure it doesn’t encounter any disturbances.
  &lt;br /&gt;8. Once the crystal creation is dried, you’re done! Feel free to hang your art, or place it as a nice, flat piece on a table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;So, how is this possible?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crystals grow when a saturated liquid (a liquid that can vaporize) with some sort of mineral cools. In this instance, our saturated liquid would be the borax water, while the mineral is the borax itself (borax is actually what is known as a soft crystal). When the water starts hot (hence why hot water works better for this activity), the rapidly moving molecules cling onto the borax in a sense, which is why it seems dissolved and unseen. As the solution gets colder and colder (during the few hours you wait), water molecules move farther from each other (since they bounce off of each other less and less), meaning that the water cannot hold onto the dissolved borax well. Water lets go of the borax, and it evaporates, thus creating the crystal shape you should see if the craft is done properly. In other words, as the water cools down, borax cannot sustain itself in the molecules, so it protrudes outwards, forming crystals that grow increasingly bigger as the water cools down. Thus, the longer you wait, the larger the crystals get.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether it be room decor or on the next Christmas tree, this simple yet elegant craft makes great use out of only a few simple ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Ever since the concept of genetic engineering emerged in the early 1970s, various genetic discoveries have ensued. And although genetic engineering has stirred up plenty of controversy over the years, it remains the most important tool of biotechnology and one that has proved to be very promising, especially in the medical field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is genetic engineering?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genetic engineering, also known as genetic modification, is the process of altering the DNA in an organism’s genome by swapping base pairs, deleting them or even introducing a whole gene to modify or enhance certain traits of the organism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This technology has been applied in various areas. A simple example of genetic engineering in plants is providing them with herbicide resistance, which allows farmers to spray for weeds without damaging their crops. The first herbicide-resistant soybeans were introduced in 1996 by the American agrochemical company Monsanto under the title “Roundup Ready”. According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.beyondpesticides.org/programs/genetic-engineering/herbicide-tolerance#:~:text=Monsanto%20first%20introduced%20glyphosate%2Dresistant,engineered%20to%20be%20glyphosate%20resistant.&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Beyond Pesticides&lt;/a&gt;, these crops have become prevalent in American agriculture with 93% of soybeans, 82% of cotton and 85% of corn engineered to be herbicide-resistant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In medicine, a number of breakthroughs were made through genetic engineering. In addition to synthesizing human insulin using bacteria, scientists were also able to get bacteria to produce human growth hormone, alpha interferon and the hepatitis B vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gene therapy is also a recent technology closely associated with genetic engineering. It involves manipulating human genes to treat genetic diseases as opposed to genetic engineering’s purpose of enhancing already normal genes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://courses.lumenlearning.com/boundless-microbiology/chapter/genetic-engineering-products/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Lumen Learning&lt;/a&gt;, gene therapy has been used lately in clinical trials to treat conditions like cystic fibrosis, AIDS and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The history of insulin&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diabetes is a disorder that causes the body’s blood glucose levels to rise to dangerously high levels. It’s a very common condition that can be treated by injecting insulin, which allows glucose to be taken up by the liver and other tissues. Consequently, cells obtain the glucose they require and blood glucose levels remain normal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially, insulin was obtained from the pancreases of animals, primarily pigs and cows, and used safely to manage diabetes for years. But it came with its drawbacks and over time, cases of adverse reactions associated with animal-derived insulin were reported. Also, extracting insulin from animals wasn’t exactly cost-effective. According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gene.com/stories/cloning-insulin&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Gene&lt;/a&gt;, 8,000 pounds of pancreas glands from 23,500 animals were required to make one pound of insulin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1978, the biotechnology firm “Genentech” produced human insulin using the bacteria E. coli, making insulin the first-ever human protein manufactured through biotechnology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in 1982, the pharmaceutical company, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lilly.com/company/about-lilly/milestones-of-caring-and-discovery&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Eli Lilly&lt;/a&gt;, introduced the first-ever genetically-engineered human insulin under the brand name “Humulin”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How the process works&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogs/2021/february/engineeringBacteriaTwo.png&quot; width=&quot;60%&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin: 0 auto&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;The diagram shows the steps leading up to the production of human insulin.

&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Since the bacterium E. coli is known for having the fastest reproduction rate among bacteria (they can double in number every 20 minutes!), it is the preferred organism for human insulin production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the human insulin gene found in the human DNA is cut using a restriction enzyme.
A small part of the bacterial plasmid (a circular piece of DNA independent from the bacterium’s chromosome) is also cut out using a restriction enzyme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ligase enzymes are used to insert the human insulin gene into the plasmid and join the two together. A recombinant plasmid, assembled out of fragments from various sources, is obtained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;The insulin gene is inserted into the plasmid and its ends are joined together with the plasmids using DNA ligase. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.khanacademy.org/science/ap-biology/gene-expression-and-regulation/biotechnology/a/overview-dna-cloning&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;(KhanAcademy)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The recombinant plasmid, now containing the insulin gene, is injected into a bacterial cell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The human insulin gene is treated just like any other bacterial gene and is therefore transcribed into mRNA and then translated into proteins following the ordinary molecular machinery of protein synthesis. In this case, the protein of interest is called human insulin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bacteria are put in a fermenter (also known as a fermentation tank), which provides optimal conditions for bacterial growth. Bacteria can then reproduce rapidly in the tank, resulting in millions of insulin-gene-bearing bacteria that synthesize human insulin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since bacteria synthesize their own bacterial proteins in addition to the human insulin protein, the latter must be extracted and purified before packaging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biotechnology has drawn plenty of controversy despite all the breakthroughs it has led to. Several aspects of genetic engineering, in particular, were questioned. While the benefits of this field could be tremendous, many showed their apprehension over the consequences such a powerful tool can bring about. Since genetically-engineered organisms are still novel and not entirely understood, their release could present an ecological imbalance. And an accident in engineering the genetics of a bacteria or a virus, for example, could result in an unmanageable type of microorganisms that could lead to a fatal epidemic when released. There is no doubt that genetic engineering will still continue to raise many debates over the years, so further research will always be required in order to ensure the safety of any product produced using this precious but destructive tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;This illustration showcases the variety of topics and functions related to Machine learning and demonstrates how expansive this field has become.
(Dataversity)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Being one of the most popular computer science fields, machine learning (ML) has come a long way since &lt;a href=&quot;https://labelyourdata.com/articles/history-of-machine-learning-how-did-it-all-start/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;its inception back in the 1940s&lt;/a&gt;. It has been expanding ever since then and will likely continue to do so. But wait, what is ML? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/machine-learning&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;According to IBM&lt;/a&gt;, it “focuses on applications that learn from experience and improve their decision-making or predictive accuracy over time.” ML is a branch of the much bigger artificial intelligence (AI) field in both computer science and technology in general, and it has a central focus on algorithms. The better the algorithm, the more efficient the ML will be in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the field’s inception technically being in the 1940s, it did not truly start becoming the ML we know today until the 1950s. To be more specific, &lt;a href=&quot;https://labelyourdata.com/articles/history-of-machine-learning-how-did-it-all-start/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;1956&lt;/a&gt; marked the year of the Dartmouth Workshop, which has been credited countless times as &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/cantors-paradise/the-birthplace-of-ai-9ab7d4e5fb00&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;“the birthplace of AI”&lt;/a&gt; over the years. During this workshop, 20 of the most intelligent minds in computer and cognitive science were brought together to work on a project seeking to uncover the degree to which computers and other machinery could push themselves. The event lasted approximately seven weeks and acted as one giant brainstorming session to figure out ways to push computers to their full potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/cantors-paradise/the-birthplace-of-ai-9ab7d4e5fb00&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Some outcomes&lt;/a&gt; of this workshop included John McCarthy (the event’s main organizer) coining the term ‘artificial intelligence’ during the conference and Arthur Samuels (one of the intelligent minds) eventually coining the term ‘machine learning’ three years later in 1959. Samuels would go on to create the Samuel Checkers-playing program, which was one of the world’s first self-learning programs. &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/rla-academy/dartmouth-workshop-the-birthplace-of-ai-34c533afe992&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Other outcomes&lt;/a&gt; involved Herbert Simon and Allen Newell (more of the intelligent minds) showing off Logic Theorist, which was the first program designed to copy the problem-solving skills of a human being after observing them in action and committing them to memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though the Dartmouth Workshop was centered around the advancement of AI, it had numerous outcomes, one of these being the creation of ML. Thus, the event not only was the birthplace of AI, but it was also technically the birthplace of ML as well. From there, the ML field continued its &lt;a href=&quot;https://labelyourdata.com/articles/history-of-machine-learning-how-did-it-all-start/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ever-growing expansion&lt;/a&gt;, eventually reaching another milestone during the 1980s and 1990s. This milestone was a change of focus from gaining more knowledge (which was ML’s main purpose before) to a new approach centered around data. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~jce317/history-machine-learning.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;This new paradigm&lt;/a&gt; would make it so computers would learn from batches of data, rather than storing them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new approach in the ML field was mainly centered around neural networks and support vector machines (SVM), with the former being the bigger focus. While the term ‘neural networks’ may seem daunting at first, it actually is not too hard to understand. Essentially, &lt;a href=&quot;https://victorzhou.com/blog/intro-to-neural-networks/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a neural network&lt;/a&gt; is a bundle of neurons all clumped together that work towards a specific goal. When it comes to ML, that ‘specific goal’ is making sure computers and other machinery can take various groups of data and learn from them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogs/2021/february/machineLearningTwo.jpg&quot; width=&quot;60%&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin: 0 auto&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;This illustrates a simple neural network. Yes, this is what exists inside all computers and other machinery!
&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/coinmonks/the-artificial-neural-networks-handbook-part-1-f9ceb0e376b4&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;(Medium - VIASAT)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for &lt;a href=&quot;https://towardsdatascience.com/support-vector-machine-introduction-to-machine-learning-algorithms-934a444fca47&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;SVMs&lt;/a&gt;, these act, as their name suggests, primarily for support. They help organize all the different data they come across through the use of margins and hyperplanes (which are used for &lt;a href=&quot;https://towardsdatascience.com/https-medium-com-pupalerushikesh-svm-f4b42800e989&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;data separation&lt;/a&gt;), which work together to classify data. SVMs are also big on math. There is a wide variety of functions (mainly ones relating to calculus) used in relation to SVMs, which are used for problem solving, and they may be even more sophisticated than neural networks as a result of this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever since this new focus on neural networks and SVMs, ML has found itself being used for a variety of applications. For example, Facebook created the &lt;a href=&quot;https://labelyourdata.com/articles/history-of-machine-learning-how-did-it-all-start/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;DeepFace technology in 2014&lt;/a&gt; with the use of neural networks, which is used to recognize user facial features. In 2017, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/7/16615290/waymo-self-driving-safety-driver-chandler-autonomous&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Waymo introduced autonomous cars&lt;/a&gt; and used ML to learn from user feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ML is impressive. Even though it started out as a spinoff of the much popular AI field, it has now become just as popular. This popularity has yielded its own spinoff in the form of deep learning, as mentioned before. Many discoveries were made within a short period of time after its inception, and many more are surely still on the horizon. This optimism contributes to the positive and exciting outlook that ML is always changing, never staying the same for a prolonged period of time due to the constant discoveries. This only makes the field ever more popular, &lt;a href=&quot;https://codeburst.io/what-is-the-future-of-machine-learning-f93749833645&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;as its applications will only continue to increase&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
