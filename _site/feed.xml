&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
On Jan. 9, 1992, scientists discovered the first exoplanet, or rather, two exoplanets orbiting the pulsar PSR 1257+12. The finding paved the path for the discovery of over 4,000 new exoplanets in the next few decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exoplanets are planets that orbit stars outside the solar system. While the majority orbit other stars, some are free-floating, or rogue, planets. Measuring their size and mass allows astronomers to determine their compositions, which range from solid rock to gas. These properties are remarkably similar to those of regular planets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The elements that make up exoplanets are also much like those that comprise planets in our solar system, though current technology is not yet advanced enough to directly determine the specific compositions. Instead, scientists rely on the elemental abundance in nearby stars. Specifically, they use a method called stellar spectroscopy, where they observe the interactions between light and the elements contained within a star’s upper layers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the initial discovery of exoplanets by radio astronomers Aleksander Wolszczan and Dale Frail, NASA has used the Kepler Space Telescope and various techniques to discover thousands more. One such method is the wobble, or radial velocity, method, which, according to NASA, “measures changes in a star’s ‘radial velocity.’ The wavelengths of starlight are alternatively squeezed and stretched as a star moves slightly closer, then slightly farther away.” This method was used to discover an exoplanet about half the size of Jupiter in 1995. The gas giant moved in a very fast four-day orbit around its parent star. This irregular wobbling movement was detected by telescopes on Earth, prompting the development of the wobble method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the process of exoplanet hunting may have been slow at first, the Kepler telescope made it much faster. &lt;a href=&quot;https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/discovery/how-we-find-and-characterize/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt; describes how “Kepler settled into an Earth-trailing orbit, then fixed its gaze on a small patch of sky… Within that small patch were 150,000 stars.” This discovery was vital for the development of the transit method, which allows astronomers to determine a planet’s orbital size and the star’s mass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, there are four classifications for exoplanets: Gas giant, super-Earth, Neptunian and Terrestrial. Gas giants are large planets primarily composed of gas, much like the name suggests. Super-Earths are mainly composed of rock but are much larger than Earth. Neptunian exoplanets are about the size of the planet Neptune and are also mostly composed of gas. Lastly, Terrestrial exoplanets are rocky planets similar to Earth, Mars, Mercury and Venus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most promising features of exoplanets is that some may contain water or ice. As water is a key aspect of life, its presence could support the ability for life to exist on exoplanets. To better understand this, it’s important to discuss the concept of habitability, the quality of supporting life. In order to be habitable, a planet must have specific features, including temperature, chemical makeup, radiation level, oxygen and water (or an equivalent life-supporting substance).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;
In the image above, there are planets outside and within the habitable zone based on their distance from the star.

&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The search for habitable planets is an important one, and recent developments are helping scientists move a step closer. According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.americanscientist.org/article/big-data-on-exoplanet-composition&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;American Scientist&lt;/a&gt;, astrophysicist Natalie Hinkel built “a publicly available database, called the Hypatia Catalog, to help researchers explore this deeper aspect of habitability.” Hinkel and her colleagues have recently modeled the TRAPPIST-1 system. Within the system, three of the planets are located in what is called a “habitable zone”, or region around a star that is the right temperature to allow liquid water to exist. Hinkel explains, “as the Hypatia Catalogue grows, it should become an increasingly valuable scientific resource.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One recent exoplanet development includes the discovery of a potentially habitable planet resembling Earth. This was announced on April 15, 2020, by NASA and the SETI Institute. Called Kepler-1649c, the planet is 300 light-years away from Earth and almost the same size. Not only does it orbit in the habitable zone of its star, but its temperatures are hypothesized to be very similar to Earth’s, further supporting its potential to support life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another crucial development was announced on the same day: Proxima Centauri b, an even larger exoplanet, was spotted orbiting a star nearest to the sun. As stated by &lt;a href=&quot;https://earthsky.org/space/exoplanets-kepler-1649c-proxima-centauri-c-nasa-seti-institute-sphere-vlt/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;EarthSky&lt;/a&gt;, “What’s puzzling is that the possible planet appears significantly brighter than it should. If the brightness was entirely from the light reflected off the planet itself, then the planet would be about five times larger than Jupiter. But its estimated mass is more similar to Neptune’s.” This unexpected finding has led scientists to postulate that Proxima Centauri b has a ring system, which would greatly increase its size but have a negligible effect on its mass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Kepler-1649c and Proxima Centauri b are evidence that there is still much to discover in the universe, and exoplanets may be a key piece to the puzzle. While a lot of progress has been made with regards to exoplanet discovery, there are still infinitely many questions left unanswered. Perhaps scientists will even discover an exoplanet harboring life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Race and gender disparities remain a significant challenge in STEM industries and the future of the American workforce. Among STEM workers, African Americans are centerpoint for concerns that there is too little attention paid to increasing racial and ethnic diversity; their high experience with issues with diversity in the workforce is constantly met with failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this regard, blacks working in STEM jobs share a lot in common with Asian Americans, and to a lesser extent with Hispanic residents who are all less likely than whites in such jobs to believe that members of their own communities can achieve promotions and awards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most blacks in these positions believe major underlying factors prevent involvement in STEM fields such as limited access to high-quality education, recruitment discrimination and a lack of encouragement to pursue these careers from an early age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Most Americans see racial and ethnic diversity in the workplace as important&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Americans not only place a level of importance on diversity in the workplace, but these views extend to race and ethnicity as well. Eight-in-ten Americans say it is important to have diversity in all workplaces, recognizing that it is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2018/01/09/blacks-in-stem-jobs-are-especially-concerned-about-diversity-and-discrimination-in-the-workplace/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;“extremely” or “very important.”&lt;/a&gt; In comparison, less than 10% find racial and ethnic diversity to be “not too” or “not at all important.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When asked which are valid reasons for increasing racial and ethnic diversity in the workplace, 45% of adults say it provides unique perspectives that contribute to overall business goals, while the same number says it gives many the equal opportunity to succeed. A smaller share believes that it creates a larger American workforce which in turn helps the national economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large public support for racial and ethnic diversity in the workplace is relevant with recent polls which emphasize traditional value reform. For example, a 2017 Pew Research Center report found that most Americans believe an increasing number of different worker racial groups, ethnic groups and nationalities in the U.S. makes the nation a safer and better place to live in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;African Americans in the STEM workforce stress workplace diversity&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The majority of white, black, Hispanic and Asian STEM employees see racial and ethnic diversity in the workplace as somewhat critical, but there are wide differences in their areas of importance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blacks are more likely to say racial and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blackenterprise.com/64-of-blacks-say-racism-and-discrimination-are-issues-at-their-workplace/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ethnic diversity in the workplace is extremely or very important&lt;/a&gt; than their white co-workers. Sentiments on this particular topic among Hispanic and Asian employees typically sway the unique culture of a company. This has come under heavy scrutiny by the public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this forecast, STEM employees look similar to other job positions. Blacks and Hispanics in non-STEM careers similarly believe that they are more likely than whites in such jobs to believe that these ideals are very important in their careers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Racial, ethnic and gender pay gaps are still large&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Black and Hispanic workers remain widely underrepresented while representation varies for women according to new reports, efforts to promote equity and equality still have a long way to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2019/06/07/new-study-finds-discrimination-against-women-and-racial-minorities-hiring-sciences&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;(Inside Higher Ed)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2018/01/09/blacks-in-stem-jobs-are-especially-concerned-about-diversity-and-discrimination-in-the-workplace/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Pew Research&lt;/a&gt;, the typical woman’s salary from 2017 to 2019 in STEM was about 75% of a man’s salary. That gap narrowed from 70% in 2016, but it was still wider than the pay gap in the overall workforce with women earning 80% of male salary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Racial and ethnic disparities in STEM salaries have also widened in recent years. Black STEM professionals typically earned, at most, 80% of white workers’ earnings from 2017 to 2019 — down from 82% in 2016. And average pay for Hispanic professionals in STEM was 83% of white earnings — down from 85% in that very year. Meanwhile, Asian professionals rose by 2%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Looking Ahead&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pew findings are not surprising, but understanding why the numbers are where they are is even more important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The barriers to entering STEM are very different for each group, but many underprivileged groups have to work through the adversity of the gamut of limited education and lack of STEM role models in local communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early-career, student-led nonprofit movements like InterSTEM are not backing down and are instead empowering young students. These actions are aimed to help underprivileged children achieve their potential and will help create a more diverse and accepting workforce of the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;The image above shows the surface of Mars.

&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
For as long as humans have studied astronomy, Mars has been defined by its reddish-orange hue. However, recent scientific discovery has noted that Mars closely resembled Earth billions of years ago, with lakes, rivers, seas, oceans and perhaps even life. And due to gradual processes that are taking place right now, Earth will closely resemble Mars in the distant future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hue on Mars is a product of natural chemical processes. Mars is a terrestrial planet, composed of silicate rocks and metals. All metals are susceptible to a chemical process known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://chem.libretexts.org/Ancillary_Materials/Exemplars_and_Case_Studies/Exemplars/Physics_and_Astronomy/Astronomy%3A_The_Earth_and_Corrosion&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;corrosion&lt;/a&gt;, which happens through oxidation. In chemistry, oxidation is the loss of electrons during a chemical reaction, and reduction is the complementary gain of electrons. When metals are oxidized, they corrode and become a reddish-orange hue. For example, iron is oxidized by water and oxygen, creating rust:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4Fe + 3O2 + 6H2O → 4Fe(OH)3&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All metals are electropositive and are disposed to losing electrons in a chemical reaction. Therefore, corrosion puts metals in their most natural and chemically stable state, and all metals—including stainless steel or silver—are susceptible to a type of corrosion at some point. This also means that terrestrial planets, composed of metal, are susceptible to corrosion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a much larger scale, atmospheric escape plays a major role in Mars’ hue. Atmospheric escape is a natural planetary process in which atmospheric gases are lost to outer space. The driving factor of atmospheric escape is heat; as gases are heated, they expand. Atmospheres are bound only by gravity, and at 5,778 K (9,941°F), the Sun provides more than enough heat to lift an atmosphere away from its planet. Through deep analysis of the Martian surface, planetary scientists have come to a consensus that &lt;a href=&quot;https://astrobiology.nasa.gov/news/water-on-mars-the-story-so-far/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mars used to be full of water&lt;/a&gt;, which explains how it dried out and corroded. At high enough temperatures, water can break down into hydrogen and oxygen. Hydrogen has the lowest atomic weight of all elements and can therefore easily escape into the atmosphere and then into space. Oxygen, almost 16 times heavier, expands into space at a much slower rate. Therefore, while hydrogen was escaping from Mars, oxygen remained on the surface for a bit and oxidized the surface of Mars. The data correspond—the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.universetoday.com/14702/what-is-mars-made-of/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Martian crust&lt;/a&gt;, corroded from oxidization, is composed of iron, magnesium, aluminum, calcium and potassium, along with oxygen and silicon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;A CGI interpretation of an ancient ocean on Mars, billions of years ago.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nasa.gov/press/2015/march/nasa-research-suggests-mars-once-had-more-water-than-earth-s-arctic-ocean/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;(NASA)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite also being a terrestrial planet with an abundance of water, Earth has not corroded. Two major factors that explain this are gravity and magnetism. The gravity of an object is determined by its mass, and the magnetism is determined by its electric currents. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/goddard/2020/mars-electric-currents/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mars lacks a global magnetic field&lt;/a&gt;, and due to its mass, only has 38% of Earth’s gravitational pull, so it can’t grip onto its atmosphere quite as effectively as Earth can. Still, Earth’s atmosphere is constantly being pulled away from its surface. In a few billion years, however, external factors will create the ideal environment for Earth’s corrosion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each star, including our Sun, is powered through nuclear fusion of hydrogen and helium gas in its core. Nuclear fusion releases substantial amounts of energy, which causes a star to expand, but due to expanding, it loses density, cools down and compresses, causing it to release more energy again. These complementary and spontaneous reactions help stars remain in equilibrium, with a persistent size and shape, until they eventually &lt;a href=&quot;https://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/educators/lifecycles/LC_main3.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;run out of hydrogen and die&lt;/a&gt;. However, stars are not in an equilibrium of heat. According to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://usm.maine.edu/planet/sun-getting-hotter-if-so-why-will-earth-eventually-become-too-hot-life#:~:text=Astronomers%20estimate%20that%20the%20Sun's,too%20hot%20to%20support%20life.&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;University of Southern Maine&lt;/a&gt;, “As the Sun ages, it slowly grows hotter due to the accumulation of residual energy emitted by these core reactions.” When the Sun’s heat becomes more intense, the rate of atmospheric escape will increase, and atmospheric escape on Earth will finally be rapid enough to create another dry, corroded planet. The intense heat, absence of water and thin atmosphere will cause life on Earth to come to a halt. Fortunately, this process will only occur in a few billion years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the impacts of atmospheric escape will only be seen on Earth in the distant future, atmospheric escape itself is actively occurring. It is actively occurring on Mars, on exoplanets, but most relevantly, on planet Earth. Wherever there’s a planet in a solar system, there’s atmospheric escape, and that includes Earth with all its uniqueness and vitality. Outer space is not distant from Earth, but rather it encompasses Earth, and so do its laws. Earth, a planet set apart by its unique ability to contain life, will eventually become another dry, lifeless, corroded planet. And Mars, a dry, lifeless, corroded planet, possibly contained ancient life. Once the Sun becomes a gas giant, Earth will become engulfed. So, while Earth is extraordinary, it isn’t quite extraordinary enough to resist the forces of outer space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/03/28/521665654/paralyzed-man-uses-thoughts-to-control-his-own-arm-and-hand&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;(NPR)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Bill Kochevar never thought he would be able to feed himself again. After a tragic biking incident, Kochevar was paralyzed from his neck down. For many years, he couldn’t even scratch an itch himself: he depended totally on caregivers. But in 2017, researchers at &lt;a href=&quot;https://engineering.case.edu/groups/BrainGate2/node/11&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Case Western University&lt;/a&gt; developed an electromechanical system that mimicked Kochevar’s spinal cord. At the end of the study, he was able to grab a mug of water, drink through a straw and scratch his nose with a sponge. Through two arrays of sensors in his brain and electrodes in his right arm, Kochevar saw the impossible happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kochevar is one of only 24 people around the world who have received sensors implanted into their brain to aid with paralysis. But given that up to 500,000 people suffer from spinal cord injuries each year according to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/spinal-cord-injury&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; (WHO), and even more suffer from neurological diseases and mental illnesses, brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) bear incredible healing potential. They may even make our daily lives far more convenient, both for the patients and those who interact with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many varieties of BCIs, from the electrode system that helped Kochevar regain function in his arm to circuits that help the user control technology with their brain, all the way to AI-equipped super brains currently under development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A research paper conducted by &lt;a href=&quot;https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2017/02/brain-computer-interface-allows-fast-accurate-typing-by-people-with-paralysis.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Stanford University&lt;/a&gt; showed the progress of neural interfaces that are able to allow people to type on a screen using brain signals. In the study, three participants with limb weakness were able to type at a rate of eight words per minute through one to two arrays of electrodes that were inserted into their brains. The electrodes were able to receive signals from the participants’ motor cortex and transmitted them to a nearby computer. The computer then translated the data into point-and-click commands, enabling the participants to move the cursor to click on keys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another study by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/news/pioneering-brain-implant-restores-paralysed-man-s-sense-of-touch-1.20804&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Pittsburgh University&lt;/a&gt; aimed to give Nathan Copeland’s sense of touch back in his arm. Copeland was 18 years old when he was in a car accident that rendered him paralyzed and unable to feel his lower half. Copeland had two electrode arrays implanted into his somatosensory cortex (which embeds sensation) and two other electrodes positioned in the motor cortex (which controls hand and arm movement). They linked a robotic arm to the neural interface and programmed it such that Copeland could feel anything that touched the robotic arm on his own arm. The research team electrically stimulated these regions, and as a result, Copeland was able to feel the sensations, including which fingers were being touched and the regions of those fingers. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/28/opinion/sunday/brain-machine-artificial-intelligence.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mr. Copeland&lt;/a&gt; described them as “weird,” “electrical tingly” but also “amazing.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Broadly speaking, BCIs use brain signals to enhance the brain’s functions. How does this technology work? The human brain has over 86 billion neurons. Neurons have three main parts: the dendrite, the soma and the axon. The dendrite receives signals, the somas are the processing units and axons send out the information. When the total input arriving in the soma exceeds a certain threshold, the axon generates a short electrical pulse. Neural interfaces work through a series of electrodes that gather data from these pulses. A chip on the scalp analyzes the data and can even communicate with other technologies using Bluetooth and artificial intelligence, software that allows machines to mimic human functions. AI is now able to detect the important signals and analyze them, then execute different motions accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a BCI, people can control home appliances, activate car brakes and type and control cursors just by thinking. BCIs can also deliver targeted electromagnetic pulses to improve memory, attention and consciousness for cognitively impaired patients and alleviate symptoms for chronic pain, substance abuse and depression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this all may seem like something out of a science fiction novel, BCIs are arriving at the forefront of society sooner than you think. Once this technology is popularized, it may be accessible not just to patients with spinal cord injuries, but to everyone. According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://venturebeat.com/2019/11/20/ctrl-labs-ceo-well-have-neural-interfaces-in-less-than-5-years/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;VentureBeat&lt;/a&gt;, CTRL-labs CEO Thomas Reardon believes neural interfaces will be commercially available in the mid-2020s. Back in 2017, &lt;a href=&quot;https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2017/02/brain-computer-interface-allows-fast-accurate-typing-by-people-with-paralysis.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Dr. Krishna Shenoy&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of electrical engineering at Stanford, predicted that “the day will come — closer to five than 10 years from now… when a self-calibrating, fully implanted wireless [BCI] can be used without caregiver assistance, has no cosmetic impact and can be used around the clock.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In just a few short years, it could be perfectly normal to drive without touching a steering wheel, receive the weather forecast in your head and direct your thermostat to warm up or cool down while you’re nowhere near it. BCIs still can’t read brain signals with perfect accuracy, but they are rapidly improving. The better they become, the more they will continue making the impossible, possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogs/2021/may/aiOne.png&quot; width=&quot;60%&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin: 0 auto&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;The image above depicts the painting Edmond de Belamy. (Christies)
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Some computer systems are even capable of developing abstract forms of creativity similar to individual thought in the form of meaningful literature and paintings. An example of computer-minded artwork is “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmond_de_Belamy&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1620609012096000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw2HLL-SXOXuUBHDT85hEuf8&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Edmond de Belamy&lt;/a&gt;”, a fully AI-generated “painting.” Through deep learning, AI is able to imitate a creative mind based on previous human work, as seen in the paint strokes and the prominent human figure wearing a suit and collared shirt.  Apart from the visual aspect of art, AI is well capable of creating forms of analytical literature. An open-source artificial intelligence, &lt;a href=&quot;https://openai.com/blog/gpt-2-1-5b-release/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;GPT-2&lt;/a&gt;, has created multiple excerpts of poetry and fictional writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is an example-
And, ere the cloud of the tempest blew,
His soul was with the world at play.
He looked to the stars, and the stars smiled,
And the moon in the heaven looked;
And, as he looked, he beheld her light,
And all the heaven smiled with him.
When winds and tempests fly,
When floods and fires fail,
As their wake doth meadow and fen,
Tis the man-child’s heart that craves.
And I — I shall be bound,
With the hoary-headed, strong, old,
To earth, and the graves of the dead,
Whose feet are mowed down, as they lie;
And I shall rest my weary head,
In the silence of Eternity,
In the peaceful arms of God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outstandingly, GPT-2 not only generated a meaningful poem with the possibility of thoughtful creative analysis, but it has also expressed human emotion, religion and curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The moral argument against AI&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI has constantly proven itself to imitate and exceed human behavior, but this raises concerns within the public opinion: Will AI take away jobs? What will happen to targeted workers? Can AI take over the world?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In reality, these are valid arguments. As this technology advances further in complexity, it can very well branch out and perform tasks related to other fields of work. This seems highly plausible in the coming years as AI has been appealing to most companies since machine learning and neural networking is proven to be much more accurate and sustainable than manual labor. Some are already adopting this fully automated system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Yangshan Deep-Water Port is the biggest fully automated container port in Shanghai. “It’s all controlled by artificial intelligence,” Yang Jiemin, who is in charge of technological support, said to &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.cgtn.com/news/3d637a4e31677a4d/share_p.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CGTN&lt;/a&gt;, as he describes the 24/7 fully automated workforce. If this trend of adopting AI-powered machines grows, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.usnews.com/news/economy/articles/2019-06-26/report-robots-will-replace-20-million-manufacturing-jobs-by-2030&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1620609000911000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw34zLkFfkEoxLL170XjX7ii&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;by 2030, over 20 million jobs could be replaced by machine learning robots&lt;/a&gt;. The fact of the matter is, the complexity and sheer capabilities of machine learning could result in public opinion that sides against the growth of artificial intelligence. The reason being? Robots can replace manual workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from the possibility of AI taking over the workforce, many believe it is on its path to take over the world. Although it may seem that AI could develop into an evil army of robotic human beings, most probably due to sci-fi films, AI computing is unable to understand the world through a moral aspect. Partaking in a war against humanity is far beyond machine learning’s algorithmic capabilities. And while it may seem as if AI has this abstract understanding through its literary and visual art forms, it is unable to fully comprehend what exactly it is generating. After all, a computer system, even as advanced as complex deep learning systems, is unconscious. Algorithms dictate AI capabilities, and a basic understanding of morality is a concept that cannot be written out in an algorithmic form. Translating emotion into binary values for the computer to understand does not seem plausible to achieve anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Should AI continue to develop?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consequences of AI are definitely apparent, but the possibilities this field could create are not something our technologically dependent society should overlook. AlphaGo is a Google DeepMind computer program specified to perform tasks in the abstract strategy board game, Go. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/latest-ai-teaches-itself-play-games-no-human-help-180965322/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;AlphaGo trained for only a staggering 40 days&lt;/a&gt;. After this short training period, it was able to defeat 18-time world champion Lee Se-dol. To put this into perspective, Go is speculated to be a 2,500-year-old board game that originated in China. AlphaGo was self-trained during the 40 days by repeatedly playing over 40 million games against itself. Within this time period, AlphaGo was able to learn and test strategies that have been developing for the past 25 centuries at the highest possible level. If this deep mind software was able to defeat some of the greatest Go minds in history through new strategies and quick decision making, similar deep learning programs could be implemented to assist human practice throughout a multitude of fields of work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In modern-day technology, this is how AI is currently being used. Some of the most common forms of computer intelligence are actually present in everyday tasks, such as virtual assistants on your mobile phone or self-driving cars seen around roads. All these are used to assist human tasks and speed up daily processes. They are not replacing human appearance. If we are able to use AI as a tool to refine human lives, the fear of robots replacing human work would become non-existent and technological advancements would become much more rapid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;
Apple’s iPhones are currently competing with mobile phones from other countries, such as Huawei from China and Samsung from South Korea.&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeQnQ-vjtuY&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;(YouTube)&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apple.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; is the top mobile phone brand in the United States, with approximately 65% of the national market share. However, this statistic is not necessarily representative of the global market, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/top-five-smartphone-companies-in-the-world-2020-09-03&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;records&lt;/a&gt; from 2020 show that Apple ranked third in the global smartphone market with 13% of the market share. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.samsung.com/us/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt;, placing second, claimed 19%, while the leading company, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.huawei.com/us/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Huawei&lt;/a&gt;, held 20%. These rankings still stand in 2021, and as Apple, Huawei and Samsung continue to compete for consumers, the spotlight falls on a product that they all have in common: the smartphone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arguably the most iconic smartphone brand in the world, Apple released its newest iPhone, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apple.com/iphone-12-pro/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;iPhone 12 Pro Max&lt;/a&gt;, on Nov. 13, 2020. The iPhone 12 Pro is powered by Apple’s newest chip, the A14 Bionic, which is the first 5-nanometer chip in the microchip industry featuring a grand total of 11.8 billion transistors. The camera sensors (named the Pro camera system) are also 47% larger than the ones of the previous iPhone. In addition to its larger size, the featured cameras include a new 65 mm telephoto lens and 5X optical zoom range that uses Deep Fusion and Neural Engine to analyze multiple exposures pixel by pixel to bring out unprecedented detail in the photos it takes. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are also used - machine learning helps separate the subject from the background in photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogs/2021/april/innovationTwo.png&quot; width=&quot;60%&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin: 0 auto&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;
A snapshot of Apple’s new and improved Pro camera system.

&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The 12 Pro utilizes a LiDAR Scanner that is basically portable Augmented Reality. The LiDAR Scanner is able to measure how long it takes light to reflect back from objects, creating a depth map of any space the user is in and transforming a room into any realistic scene of the user’s choice in a matter of seconds. These features, and more, are displayed across 3.4 million pixels, the most ever in an iPhone. To complete Apple’s signature bold and simple look, the iPhone 12 Pro comes in four crisp colors: Pacific Blue, Gold, Silver and Graphite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has been rapidly reinventing its global image over the last decade, doubling its number of software companies with a recent count of over 37,800 active Chinese software companies as of year-end 2018, with at least a dozen of these companies reaching valuations of greater than $1 billion. One of these companies, Huawei, is best known for its rapid progress in mobile development and 5G networks, putting it in first place in the global phone manufacturing market as of Q2 2020. Huawei’s newest mobile phone, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://consumer.huawei.com/en/phones/mate-x2/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;HUAWEI Mate X2&lt;/a&gt;, was released on Feb. 25, 2021, and features the signature Huawei ability to seamlessly fold in half, offering users the option of using it as a “folded, 6.45-inch flagship smartphone, or unfolded as an 8-inch FullView Display.” To better enable this folding option, the Mate X2 utilizes a new and improved multi-dimensional hinge that is made using innovative materials and forging techniques, making the hinge discreetly concealed and giving the Mate X2 a virtually invisible seam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The ability to fold in half offers new uses for smartphone screens; unfolded, the 8-inch screen’s Smart Multi-Window feature allows users to split their screen into four windows at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Huawei’s 5 nanometer Kirin 9000 5G SoC chip is used to power the Mate X2. This chip is packed with over 15 billion transistors and an NPU (Neural Processing Unit) that pushes AI processing to a new level. The Huawei Mate X2 also uses 5G networks, in addition to Huawei’s 5G super Uplink that allows users to upload, send, and share anything at optimal speed and quality. As for cameras, each Huawei Mate X2 features a 16 MP Ultra Wide Camera lens that takes pixel-perfect photos bursting with sharpness and dynamic range. This lens is coupled with a 2.5 cm Macro Lens that can take pictures from as little as 2.5 cm away. To tie it all together, the Huawei Mate X2 boasts an “Edge of Gravity” feature where the phone’s folded shape is slightly wedged, with the thinnest part having a width of only 4.4 millimeters wide. This design not only looks slim and feels light, but keeps the center of gravity closer to where you hold it, giving you an easier grip. The Huawei Mate X2 can be found in a new color palette featuring refreshing Crystal Blue, dreamy Crystal Pink, classic Black and classic White.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Located in Seoul, South Korea, Samsung is one of the top mobile phone manufacturing companies in the world. Its newest release on Jan. 29, 2021, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-s21-5g/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Samsung Galaxy S21 5G&lt;/a&gt;, features an industry-leading 5G chipset that boasts 8GB of RAM (Random Access Memory) and 256 GB of built-in memory. In addition, the 5-nm processor is the fastest processor that Samsung Galaxy has released so far, supporting the phone’s powerful features, such as the four cameras located on its exterior. The strongest camera of these four is a 64 MP camera; this 64-megapixel camera takes photos with a corresponding 64MP resolution, which means that 64 million pixels can be found in every single photo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogs/2021/april/innovationFour.png&quot; width=&quot;60%&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin: 0 auto&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;
The Galaxy S21 5G features two 12MP cameras and a 64 MP camera on its outward-facing exterior.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-s21-5g/ &quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;(Samsung)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In addition to its high resolution, the Galaxy S21 5G can also zoom in up to 30x on a subject with Space Zoom, enabling users to capture distant details with stunning clarity while Zoom Lock helps keep the subject centered. The Galaxy S21 5G’s cameras are enhanced by artificial intelligence that allows photos to be analyzed for the best lighting, angles, and color possible. There is even a special AI assistant for content creators; the Single Take (AI). Single Take selects the best from a collection of photos that the user has taken, and automatically edits them for the user. As for video, the Galaxy S21 5G flaunts the highest resolution video in a smartphone, 8K, with a variety of abilities. One of these, the 8K Video Snap, lets users “snip” an album of photos that are up to 33 MP in resolution, straight out of every 8K video. Samsung captures this ground-breaking ability with the catchy quote: “record now, snap later.” To complete this high-quality, high-function, mobile device, the Samsung Galaxy S21 5G is protected by Corning Gorilla Glass Victus, the toughest glass available on a Samsung smartphone. The Galaxy S21 5G can be found as part of a Phantom color series: Phantom violet, Phantom silver and Phantom black, sure to wow consumers and solidify Samsung’s position in the smartphone market worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of these three companies, Apple, Huawei and Samsung, are innovative in their own way, whether it be specificities in hardware, application of AI, or overall presentation. However, they all share more similarities in their smartphones than the average consumer may think. For example, all three of these brand’s flagship smartphones, the iPhone 12 Pro Max, the Huawei Mate X2 and the Samsung Galaxy S21 Max, all utilize 5-nanometer processor chips, 5G networks, and artificial intelligence and machine learning. This stands as a significant piece of evidence that although different countries around the world are rapidly developing and becoming more technology-oriented and competitive, the whole world actually shares more in common than presumed differences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Honey bees have become the subjects of worldwide attention. A simple google search for “save the bees” yields a tidal wave of honey bee-oriented websites. Many websites sell shirts, jewelry and posters encouraging honey bee-focused conservation. Other websites host webinars and programs aimed at teaching people about honey bees, bee keeping and bee gardens. While honeybees play important roles in keeping ecosystems in balance, they are an introduced species everywhere but in Europe. In those places, native bees have been successfully playing the role of chief pollinator for millions of years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honey bee numbers have certainly been declining. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nrdc.org/save-bees&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Natural Resources Defense Council&lt;/a&gt; reports that, in the United States, honey bee populations declined 40% between 2017 and 2018. While these statistics are alarming, honey bees are in no real danger of extinction. Farmers and beekeepers worldwide are dedicated to managing and maintaining the population of honey bees. Native bees do not have this luxury. As a result, many species are in danger of extinction; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.discovermagazine.com/environment/while-we-worry-about-honeybees-other-pollinators-are-disappearing&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Discover Magazine&lt;/a&gt; notes that some native bees have lost “as much as 96% of their population” in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Discover Magazine, when native bees and honey bees find themselves in the same garden, the results lead to drastic declines. Honey bees typically prefer pollinating the types of plants found in household gardens or yards. When humans move into an area, the resulting landscape benefits honey bees. The introduced species outcompetes native bee species, resulting in a dangerous drop in native bee populations. These population declines can have adverse effects on the native producers of an area, putting the health of ecosystems in danger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thousands of species of native bees can be found in North America alone, and nearly a quarter of a million species can be found in the world. &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.nature.org/science/2019/08/19/focus-on-native-bees-not-honey-bees/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Nature Conservatory&lt;/a&gt; reports that the diversity of native bee species results in pollination support for an “incredible diversity of flowering plants”. On the other hand, honey bees only pollinate between 25% and 40% of flower species. The diversity of ecosystems can be threatened by this selective pollination. Maintaining the diversity seen in nature depends upon the well-being of native bees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Native bees also pollinate flowers more efficiently than honey bees. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2011/10/native-bees-are-better-pollinators-honeybees&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2011 Cornell University study&lt;/a&gt; revealed that native bees pollinate flowers two or three times better than honey bees. The Cornell University team says this is because “native bees are mostly pollen collectors”, while honey bees mostly focus on drinking the nectar of flowers. As a result, native bees take a higher amount of pollen from flowers and deposit a higher amount on the next flower they visit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If native bees are the superior pollinators, why do honey bees get so much attention? While native bees are a part of nature, honey bees participate in commercial agriculture. Humans place a higher monetary value on honey bees because of their ability to be cultivated and manipulated. For example, the California almond crop depends entirely on staggering numbers of honey bees, transported by beekeepers from all over North America. Without these honey bees, there would be a severe shortage of almonds and almond products. The Natural Resources Defense Council estimates that 15 billion dollars of crops would be lost if honey bees suddenly disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, these estimates could be very wrong. A spokesperson for the groundbreaking 2011 Cornell University study argues that “the role of native bees in crop pollination has been largely unappreciated”. He says that, if honey bee populations decline, native bee populations may be able to pick up the agricultural slack. Since native bees are more effective pollinators than honey bees, this could potentially be advantageous to the agricultural industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way to ensure that the future has healthy ecosystems and an abundant variety of agriculture is to focus on conserving native bees. Unfortunately, the public does not recognize the decline of native bees as a pressing issue. A 2019 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nrpa.org/About-National-Recreation-and-Park-Association/press-room/new-survey-shows-americans-agree-communities-should-support-pollinators-respondents-are-unsure-how-they-can-help/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;National Parks and Recreation Society survey&lt;/a&gt; revealed that 95% of people in the United States believe that honey bee protection is an issue of high concern. If honey bees continue to bask in the conservation spotlight, hundreds of native bee species will likely go extinct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2016, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/bees-endangered-list&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PBS&lt;/a&gt; announced to the public that, for the first time, seven different native bee species had been added to the endangered species list. This caused the seven species, all native Hawaiian yellow-faced wasp-like bees, to receive federal protection. Since then, more bee species have been added to the list as well, allowing them a fighting chance for survival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another positive sign for native bee populations is the skyrocketing popularity of native plant gardens. In the last decade, many homeowners and gardeners have taken part in the trend, which adds some native flair to urban areas. Native plant gardens provide native bees with their favorite host plants. Since honey bee populations often decimate native bee populations due to the availability of gardens, native plant gardens help to level the playing field between native bees and honey bees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The native bee crisis gets very little attention, but if extinction begins to spread across native bee populations, it could quickly cause an environmental crisis, and possibly an agricultural crisis. Protecting bees does not only ensure that future generations have over twenty thousand native bee species to marvel at; it also ensures humanity’s continued survival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;André Lombardi. 04/30/2021&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A common, loose-ended icebreaker question: What is your greatest fear in life? Some might mention earthquakes, spiders or heights. But for me, I’d say death. However, with a recent discovery on reverse human aging, scientists are getting even closer to elongating the lives of humans and making that ultimate fearless prominent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Ancient Egypt, the average lifetime was about 19 years due to the immense risks that children faced. Even for those who survived childhood, life expectancies, at most, were 30 years for women and 34 years for men. Fast-forward to 1920, and the life expectancy reached 53.6 years for men and 54.6 years for women. Yet, in just a century, it has soared to an average of 78.9 years in the United States. This increase in life expectancy in the past has been attributed to substantial scientific understanding in which public health measures have been adopted by the vast majority of populations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally, as the human body ages, the protective tips of chromosomes known as telomeres begin shrinking, and along with it, the body produces an increase of malfunctioning senescent cells. Senescent cells are, in short, vital in their role of tumor suppression and wound healing. Thus, an expanded malfunctioning of senescent cells can contribute to age-related diseases. In order to increase life expectancy beyond its limits and essentially rewind the process of human aging, researchers and scientists have been targeting these two integral components of the aging process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/11/201120150728.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;A clinical trial&lt;/a&gt;, involving 34 adults over the ages of 65, put a method known as hyperbaric oxygen therapy to the test, to determine if aging could in fact be reversed. The trial placed subjects in a pressurized chamber where they were supplied with pure oxygen for 90 minutes a day, five days a week over the course of three months. Data concludes that telomeres increased by about 20% average in length, and that useless cells were reduced by up to 37%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Today telomere shortening is considered the ‘Holy Grail’ of the biology of aging,” Professor Efrati of Tel Aviv University, who led the clinical trial, said. “Our HBOT protocol was able to achieve this, proving that the aging process can in fact be reversed at the basic cellular-molecular level.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, this trial and its results are providing a path forward for the future of research and are emulating how scientists can continue delving into unknown realms of science. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) can also be used for various other applications, such as treating carbon monoxide poisoning and infections or wounds where tissue is depleted or starved for oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been other attempts recently, some of which have been proven successful; others unsuccessful. In 2015, an unverified biotech company claimed that permanent changes could be made to one’s DNA that could combat muscle loss and other age-related conditions. In fact, attempts to alter life expectancy go as far back as hunter-gatherers, or approximately 30,000 years ago, with efforts to keep a tribe healthy and stable enough to survive in the long term. These days, there are significantly more technologically advanced ways we must look to increase life expectancy, such as what this trial has investigated. However, there are also numerous non-technological methods that we as a species can adapt further to increase life expectancy. Consuming a more plant-based diet, limiting exposure to cigarettes and second-hand smoking and simply getting health screenings and exams on a regular basis can all add years to the average life expectancy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As technologically interconnected and advanced, wealthy nations continue to pave the way in new technological methods, we should simultaneously exponentially increase our efforts in third world countries. Not only should we expand technological research in third world societies, such as has already been done in countries like Rwanda and Kazakhstan, but we should improve access to health screenings in these countries. Thousands of organizations, companies and initiatives have already jumpstarted the future of healthcare in these countries, but every citizen can further contribute to humanity’s attempts to increase life expectancy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, none of these studies, such as the one conducted by Tel Aviv University, can fully verify the impacts of this treatment due to the small sample size. However, time will tell, literally, how this trial will age and how humans in the future may adopt both sci-fi-like reverse aging and simple yet effective public health measures in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nadwa Atwi. 04/23/2021&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking notes is one of the most important parts of the learning process. Students often spend a lot of time considering how to take notes, only to end up choosing a technique unfit for the material they’re tackling. So here we’ll be covering the pros and cons of each and discussing the right font-color combination for ideal note-taking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Comparison&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. Accuracy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to accuracy, typing certainly wins out as it’s much faster to type than to write something down. However, this definitely depends on the material one is taking notes on. If it demands that notes be taken down verbatim then transcribing the lecturer’s speech, this would call for a laptop. But it’s very important to note that taking down notes in the form of a transcript isn’t effective for all subjects. A study was conducted by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psychologicalscience.org/news/releases/take-notes-by-hand-for-better-long-term-comprehension.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;psychology scientists Pam Mueller and Daniel Oppenheimer&lt;/a&gt; in which students were asked to write down notes on a number of TED talks using the method that they normally used to take notes. The results showed that although the two types of note-takers did equally well on questions that required facts-citation, laptop note-takers performed particularly worse on the conceptual questions. That made the scientists suggest that students who took down handwritten notes were involved in more information processing than laptop users. As a result, they sorted through the information and opted for the more relevant ones to add to their notes. Additionally, the study suggests that writing by hand improves memory retention and understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conclusion was that students who took more notes scored higher on the test, but that also applied to those who had less verbatim overlap. This proposes that unconscious transcription nullifies the advantage of having more content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. Legibility, organization and accessibility&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typing notes on a laptop offers a more aesthetic structure, easier editing and instant spelling check. So laptop users have the advantage of not having to worry about bad handwriting or making a mess of their notes when they make a mistake. While sharing handwritten notes could be a hassle, sharing digital notes is a piece of cake. Not to mention syncing them across devices makes them accessible anytime and anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3. Distractions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ease and simplicity laptops offer come at a price. Although the extra tools and resources they provide save the note-taker the inconveniences that other note-takers face, that also means more distractions. For example, many people cannot resist checking social media while they’re in a lecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Studies also show that the laptop user is not the only one affected by those distractions. According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gse.harvard.edu/news/uk/17/08/note-taking-low-tech-often-best&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Harvard University&lt;/a&gt;, researchers at York and McMaster conducted an experiment in which they had students watch a lecture and then take a comprehension test. Some students were randomly asked to carry out a couple of short tasks on their laptops during the lecture, like looking up movie times. The rest of the students were allowed to focus on the lecture. All seats were randomly assigned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, the multitasking students scored about 11% lower on the test than those who focused on the lecture. But interestingly, the students sitting near the multitaskers also got affected. Students who weren’t multitasking but could view the screen of a multitasker’s laptop scored 17% lower on comprehension than those who had no distracting view. So it’s important to note that by choosing typing as a method of note-taking, one could potentially distract those around them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Factors to consider when deciding which method to use when taking notes:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. The type of learning that is called for&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://effectiviology.com/handwriting-vs-typing-how-to-take-notes/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Effectiviology&lt;/a&gt;, note-taking through typing works better when the material requires factual learning, which involves memorizing specific details and merely entails a shallow understanding of the material. However, conceptual learning, which involves securing a rigorous understanding of the fundamental concepts in the material, calls for taking notes manually by hand.
On that account, the student must first determine the kind of material they’re dealing with and choose the note-taking method accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. The length and type of notes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another aspect a student should take into consideration is the length of the text they’ll eventually end up with. Writing notes down by hand proves to be a physically exhausting method when there’s a lot to write down, and of course, there’s a certain limit to how fast a person can write. Consequently, this method demands the note-taker to be more concise, which can be convenient since it means that only the more relevant aspects of the material are included in the notes. But the student could also end up leaving out significant details in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, typing notes allows the student to write more details, as typing is a faster process than writing. This definitely comes in handy when there are lots of points to cover. However, it’s crucial to note that there’s the disadvantage of writing too much that the unnecessary details end up overriding the important ones. That makes it more difficult to study the notes at a later time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, this depends on the type of learning that we previously discussed.
Another point worth mentioning is the type of notes the student is taking. For example, mathematical formulas are definitely faster to write down than to type. The same thing applies to sketching and labeling figures, as handwritten notes allow more freedom with the graphics and thus are more flexible in that aspect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Font color&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something that applies to both handwritten and typed notes is the font color. Color is a form of visible light, essentially a portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Each color has its own wavelength that can affect neurological pathways in the brain, creating a biochemical response. Consequently, using the right color, along with the right selection and arrangement, can have a significant impact on feelings, concentration and behavior when learning. According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.shiftelearning.com/blog/how-do-colors-influence-learning&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Shift Learning&lt;/a&gt;, although it isn’t definite science, each color can elicit its own unique biological response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Green promotes tranquility and calm and improves concentration, as it’s a low-frequency color. In a study led by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.smh.com.au/technology/seeing-green-boosts-your-concentration-research-shows-20150525-gh8udh.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Dr. Kate Lee&lt;/a&gt;, 150 university students were given a tedious task, which involved pressing a key as a series of numbers repeatedly flashed on a computer screen. They were asked not to press the key when the number three popped up on the screen. The students were given a short break halfway through the task to look at a city rooftop scene. Half of the students looked at a green roof whereas the other half viewed a bare concrete roof. After the break, students who looked at the greener scenery made considerably fewer errors and showed better concentration than those who viewed the concrete roof.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Orange is a mood lifter and a stimulator, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceofpeople.com/color-psychology/#:~:text=Orange%20is%20a%20color%20of,effect,%20and%20stimulates%20brain%20activity.&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;it has been found&lt;/a&gt; to increase oxygen supply to the brain, producing an energizing effect. It is best used for highlighting and accentuating certain parts in notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blue promotes productivity. Some research suggests that people with particularly intellectual work like programmers and academics are more productive in the presence of blue surroundings. Blue is best used for learning situations that are challenging and ones that require substantial comprehension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogs/2021/april/notetakingOne.png&quot; width=&quot;60%&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin: 0 auto&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;A student highlights words in different colors. &lt;a href=&quot;https://study.com/blog/5-tips-for-color-coding-your-notes.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;(Study)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The verdict&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to the learning method, it all comes down to preference! And the type of material one is dealing with. Both techniques have their pros and cons, but if the material equally allows for either method to be used, then writing by hand is surely the way to go because it allows learners to comprehend and retain information better than typing does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s also worth mentioning is the fact that recently, tablets have become the go-to device for students, as it bears some of the best aspects of both methods: handwritten notes that can be easily organized and shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding the font color, notes shouldn’t be kept too monochrome, so it is best to use blue along with one or two other colors. In any case, trial and error is key so remember to stay open-minded and try out different techniques with different materials.&lt;/p&gt;

So here we’ll be covering the pros and cons of each and discussing the right font-color combination for ideal note-taking.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/2021/april/notetakingCover.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/2021/april/notetakingCover.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Dopamine: The molecule that drives addiction</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2021/04/22/dopamine-the-molecule-that-drives-addiction.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Dopamine: The molecule that drives addiction" /><published>2021-04-22T17:00:01-07:00</published><updated>2021-04-22T17:00:01-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2021/04/22/dopamine-the-molecule-that-drives-addiction</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2021/04/22/dopamine-the-molecule-that-drives-addiction.html">&lt;h2 style=&quot;font-family: Ergonomique Bold&quot;&gt;Dopamine: The molecule that drives addiction

&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that is released into the brain’s reward system (right) and is released into cells (left) initiating a response. Often, an increase in the release of dopamine creates a feeling of pleasure.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The brain craves pleasure. Going on a vacation, jumping out of a plane or even taking a bite of ice cream stimulates the action of billions of neurons - the cells in our brains that send signals throughout our body to do everything from helping us walk to reading a book. There is one chemical that does consistent and important signaling using the brain’s neurons, especially when it comes to sending information about pleasure: the neurotransmitter &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenewsforstudents.org/article/explainer-what-dopamine&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;dopamine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/nucleus-accumbens&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Neurotransmitters&lt;/a&gt; are small molecules that neurons use to communicate with one another, and they help elicit certain responses like happiness from opening a gift. They also play a substantial role in our everyday actions, including moving, running and most importantly, thinking. Dopamine, a significant neurotransmitter in the brain, influences emotional activity and response. For example, it stimulates the brain so people can concentrate on certain enjoyable actions and ignore those that don’t provide the same feeling. The molecule acts on the brain’s reward system, a neuronal pathway in the brain used for transmitting emotions; when doing an activity that brings pleasure, the reward system creates feelings of joy and craving. After the consistent release of these emotions, a person’s attention span will change: “You can’t pay attention to everything, but you want to be adept as an organism at recognizing things that are novel,” Director of the National Institute of Drug Abuse &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/4001507&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Nora D. Volkow&lt;/a&gt; said. Dopamine is a chemical that allows a person to concentrate on novel and attractive things - ones that we hope to receive pleasure from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, dopamine plays a significant role in motivating a person to participate in pleasurable activities. This can range from exercising to watching a movie - anything that prolongs the release of dopamine. While many times this prolongation can be healthy (as a source of motivation and effort), too much of anything can have a dark side: uncontrolled amounts of dopamine are the primary cause of drug addiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent study by Dr. Volkow illustrates that drug abuse is associated with the increased “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/27/science/27angier.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;intensity and duration&lt;/a&gt;” of dopamine release. Street drugs like opiates and cocaine are major drivers of addiction because they increase the concentration of dopamine that cells put out. These drugs inhibit the natural mechanisms the body has to maintain balance, which in this case regulates dopamine concentration, providing the users with a burst of satisfaction or “high.” The mechanisms that keep the levels of dopamine under control involve proteins that take excess dopamine out of circulation. By imitating the shape of the molecular repressors that inhibit reuptake proteins, drugs can have a significant effect. Long-term consequences of inhibition, include the brain growing accustomed to greater concentrations of dopamine. Moreover, in many cases, this environmental change can result in the brain stopping the natural release of dopamine, creating a reliance on drugs to maintain its concentration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discovery that drug addiction stems from the increased presence of dopamine in the brain also has significant treatment implications. Frequent drug users often rely on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5171207/%23:~:text%3DThe%2520incentive%252Dsensitization%2520theory%2520posits,an%2520amplification%2520of%2520%27liking%27.&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1619249325183000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw3msOfZe9-ITtTf6UVBcdt3&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;euphoric feeling&lt;/a&gt; that dopamine provides to fuel their addiction - it gives them “motivation” to abuse certain substances. Volkow’s research opens up new treatment options for these addicts. For example, creating new medications that limit the dopamine “reward” that addicts feel from abused drugs can effectively eliminate the cause of addiction. Once available frequently, these treatments could be combined with rehab and therapy to encourage addicts to seek rewards from alternative sources like exercise or positive social interactions. Dopamine is naturally released at times of excitement, so gaining this in other ways would stimulate the normal neuronal pathways, and not ones related to drugs. These simple, yet important solutions, are key to fixing a problem present in many developing communities around the world. The safest, most effective way to address the issue would be changing its source: availability and composition drugs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Volkow is optimistic about the implications of her research: “Our findings suggest that interventions designed to enhance [dopamine] brain function in drug abusers,” noting that none of this will be successful unless treatment can “provide them with non-drug alternatives” with the ultimate goal to “help the addicted subject overcome the strong drive to take the drug.” With new treatments, the brain’s craving can be overcome.&lt;/p&gt;
