<center><i>Anders Tegnell, the leader of Sweden’s response to the pandemic, is a controversial figure for his unusual policies and stubborn beliefs. <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/09/23/swedish-fauci-blames-covid-19-deaths-on-mild-flu-season/" target="_blank">(Pontus Lundahl / TT NEWS AGENCY / AFP via Getty Images)</a></i></center>
<p><br />
Throughout this global pandemic, countries have utilized different response strategies to combat the virus and stop the spread. Sweden’s approach has by far been the most unique, as the middle-aged epidemiologist Anders Tegnell refused to shut Sweden down and insisted that a lockdown is “using a hammer to kill a fly”  For a while, the world looked at Sweden as a primary example of what not to do when combating COVID-19; however, Tegnell’s approach may still prove to be correct in the end.</p>

<p>Tegnell sought to keep schools, restaurants, gyms and borders open, and he stood resolute in his decision to not put his country in a formal lockdown, which some Swedes appreciated. Many of his employees looked up to him as an example of logic and reason while the rest of the world fell into emotional decisions and panic. In fact, Richard Milne, a reporter and writer,  notes in an article for <a href="https://www.ft.com/" target="_blank">Financial Times</a> that most Swedes supported him fully— some even going as far as tattooing his face on their bodies— because life has remained mostly normal for them. In a <a href="https://globalizationandhealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12992-020-00588-x#Tab1" target="_blank">debate</a> on the media’s report of Sweden during COVID-19, Rachel Irwin, a professor at Lund University, says the economy has been doing well and the hospitality industry increased by 1400%.</p>

<p>According to a chart from <a href="https://globalizationandhealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12992-020-00588-x/tables/1" target="_blank">Globalization and Health</a> detailing the public health measures taken in the first month (March 11 to April 16) of the pandemic response, Swedish people were advised to stay home if they felt sick, travel only if necessary, limit contacts and gatherings if over 70 years of age and avoid large public gatherings. The Public Health Agency recommended working from home as of March 16th and closing high schools and higher education as of March 17th.</p>

<p>Only on March 19th did they begin to put bans in place, including a ban on travel entry, crowding in public dining areas and events with more than 50 people.</p>

<p>While Swedes have been able to maintain their freedom and sense of normalcy, Tegnell’s strategy has meant that thousands of elderly people in care homes have died due to the disease. Sweden has the fifth-highest death rate per capita and has had far more deaths than its neighboring countries of Denmark, Norway and Finland. A chart from <a href="https://ig.ft.com/coronavirus-chart/?areas=usa&amp;areas=gbr&amp;areas=swe&amp;areas=dnk&amp;areasRegional=usny&amp;areasRegional=usca&amp;areasRegional=usfl&amp;areasRegional=ustx&amp;byDate=1&amp;cumulative=0&amp;logScale=1&amp;perMillion=1&amp;values=deaths" target="_blank">Financial Times</a> explains that Sweden was right alongside the United States and the United Kingdom in death per capita in March to June, with all three countries hitting their peak in mid-April. Denmark, along with Norway, did hit its peak at the same time, but with a third of the average deaths per a million people.</p>

<p>However, in September, there is a huge, consistent rise in the number of deaths in the United States, United Kingdom and Denmark, while that of Sweden continues to decline. This is the “second wave” mentioned often in context with COVID-19, and Sweden seems to be avoiding it, despite Tegnell’s primary intention. He sought to avoid drastic closures and reopenings because it was “going to be a disaster”, he sums up in an <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/5cc92d45-fbdb-43b7-9c66-26501693a371" target="_blank">interview</a>. Overall, his goal was to utilize Sweden’s healthcare system and view the problem from all sides, rather than focusing on lowering COVID-19 deaths.</p>

<p>Overall, Sweden’s approach, while putting elderly at risk and causing controversy, is an interesting parallel to the quick-acting, decisive measures put in place by other countries. Its number of cases spiked drastically over other countries, but the country’s number of deaths remained in line with those of the United States, United Kingdom, Denmark and Norway. Now, heading into October, scientists have predicted a second wave that has already hit the United States, and other countries appear to be nearing that second peak as well. For Sweden, their numbers are decreasing, so Tegnell’s methods may prove to be successful. Although we must wait to know what the correct response to COVID-19 should have been, it is important to take note of the different strategies each country has decided to use in case of another pandemic in the future.</p>
