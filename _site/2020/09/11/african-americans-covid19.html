		<h2 style="font-family: Ergonomique Bold">How African Americans have been affected by COVID-19</h2>
<p>Khushi Shah. 9/11/2020</p>
<hr />

<p><br />

<center><i>African American citizens of Harlem, New York, are waiting in line to receive food and masks in order to protect themselves and their families against COVID-19. (Bebeto Matthews / The Associated Press)</i></center>
<p><br />
If COVID-19 is a disease that can affect anyone, then why are people of color more prone to suffering from its repercussions? According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there are five principal causes as to why African Americans are at high risk for exposure: discrimination, healthcare access and utilization, occupation, housing and educational/income/wealth gaps.</p>

<p>The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation says it best: “Your health care depends on who you are.” The foundation estimated that minority groups such as Latinos and African Americans experience 30 to 40 percent poorer health outcomes than white Americans. African Americans are liable to racial profiling, thus causing their physical or mental pain to be viewed as their own doing or an excuse. Because of these preconceived notions, African Americans can feel discouraged to seek care and ultimately end up harming their well being even more.</p>

<p>African Americans have always had higher uninsured rates in comparison to many other ethnic groups in the United States. Although coverage rates increased from 2010 to 2016 after the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was implemented, African Americans remained 1.5 times more likely to be uninsured than their white counterparts from 2010 to 2018 according to Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF).</p>

<p>Another factor that contributes to minority groups being uninsured is that they work essential jobs, such as public transportation or farming, thus forcing them to work long hours and unable to have the luxury of taking time off. Many of these jobs provide pay that causes the annual pay of minority groups to be significantly below the United States average annual income. The average annual income of a black family is roughly $40,000, which is significantly less than other ethnic groups. Families are so focused on putting food on the table and paying rent that they cannot get a babysitter or daycare just for a hospital visit. Because culture and language barriers are inevitable in the United States, this can cause minority groups to feel uncomfortable in health care settings, as they feel that their ethnic differences will cause them to receive limited help.</p>

<p>One of the biggest effects of COVID-19 is the eviction crisis. In many racial minority groups, it is common for multiple generations of a family to live under one roof. Because these groups tend to live in more crowded conditions, they are at a higher risk for contracting the virus or exposing others to it. The eviction crisis has led to roughly 30 to 40 million Americans being on the verge of getting kicked out of their homes, which is their only source of safety and humanity during the pandemic. The Aspen Institute states that people of color are twice as likely to be renters and make up roughly 80% of people who are facing eviction in the United States of America. All across the country, minority groups have significantly higher eviction rates in comparison to White Americans, and COVID-19 has only made things worse.</p>

<p>One would think that after 50 years, the wealth gap between different races would start to shrink, but according to The Washington Post, the wealth gap between White Americans and Black Americans is just as wide as it was in 1968. In other words, the net worth of 11.5 black households is equivalent to the net worth of a white household. More money allows for individuals to further and better their education. Because African Americans are on the lower end of the wealth gap, they are often less educated in comparison to White Americans. In the situation of COVID-19, those without enough education may not have access to crucial information such as the need for social distancing and the usage of masks.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there has not been much change in the status of African Americans since the quarantine started in mid-March. Although, many protests have occurred throughout the nation to spark a change in the treatment of black Americans socially, politically, and economically.</p>
