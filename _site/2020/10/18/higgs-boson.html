<b>What is the Higgs Boson?</b><br />
Simply put, the Higgs boson is the most recent edition to the Standard Model of particle physics, and the field that produces it plays a big role in the properties of all matter in the universe. Its discovery played a big role in modern physics, as it helped people understand concepts ranging from misconceptions in the masses of certain particles to what the universe was like at its earliest stages.</p>

<p><b>History</b>
<br />In 2012, it was announced that the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) had discovered a particle that was first theorized 48 years prior. This was a particularly elusive particle that was predicted to generate mass, which was significant because it could allude to a plethora of theoretical possibilities.</p>

<p>In 1964, physicist Peter Higgs suggested the concept of a particle that caused mass. Later that same year, physicists Robert Brout and François Englert also theorized a mechanism that could produce mass and went on to win the Nobel prize for this discovery. This mechanism was named the Higgs Mechanism for Peter Higgs’ contribution to the discovery. Dick Hagen, Gerald Guralnik and Tom Kibble, who are all renowned physicists and professors, also received credit for independently publishing a similar theory not long after Higgs published his.</p>

<p><br />
In 1995, the top quark (a particle in the third generation of matter), was discovered by Fermilab in their pursuit to find the particle first theorized by Higgs 30 years prior. During this time, the  Higgs boson would gain more and more recognition from the media, and many speculations would arise, one being that the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) would create a black hole that would destroy the Earth. The Higgs boson is commonly referred to as the “God particle” because it is an integral part of the Standard Model of particle physics, which is a theory that describes the connections between three of the four fundamental forces.</p>

<p>That was, until 2008 when the LHC in Switzerland became operational. Following false rumors and debate over theories of the boson over the past few years, CERN finally announced on July 4, 2012, that <a href="https://home.cern/science/physics/higgs-boson" target="_blank">they had found a particle</a> with a mass of 125 GeV/c2, the predicted mass of the Higgs boson. After 48 years of hard work and dedication, this “God particle” had finally been found.</p>

<p><br />
That is the history of its discovery, but why does the Higgs boson matter?</p>

<p><b>How does the Standard Model classify the Higgs boson?</b>
<br />A commonly asked question about the Higgs boson is: if the Higgs is a boson, why doesn’t it carry a force? This is asked frequently because the four gauge bosons are carriers of the four fundamental forces: gravity, electromagnetism, strong interaction and weak interaction. According to the <a href="https://www.symmetrymagazine.org/article/where-the-higgs-belongs" target="_blank">Symmetry Magazine</a>, the Higgs is classified as a boson due to its integer value spin, a property of all bosons. Right now it is labeled as a “scalar boson” due to its different nature compared to the gauge bosons. For instance, it is the only elementary particle with a spin of zero.</p>

<p><b>The electroweak symmetry</b>
<br />With the discovery of the Higgs boson, several other principle theories were proven true, namely the Higgs mechanism and the Higgs field. Certain particles, like the W and Z bosons (the particles that carry the weak nuclear force), will only acquire mass if the electroweak symmetry is broken. This is only possible if a “new” field exists in all places, and this field would have to have enough energy to break the electroweak symmetry.</p>

<p>The electroweak interaction is a combination of the already manifested electromagnetic and weak nuclear forces that exist in the presence of a high energy system. It is predicted that the very early stages of the universe existed with this force present, as it took time for the four forces to separate. While this theory is proven, it requires the W and Z bosons to have no mass, which has been refuted through observation of these particles in accelerators.</p>

<p><b>The Higgs Field</b>
<br />The energy caused by the Higgs Field’s interaction with the massless particles produced by the electroweak force allows the force to break into the electromagnetic and weak interaction. This can be explained by the fact that the Higgs boson exists in a low potential energy state, and will appear when there is an excitation of energy in the Higgs field. This scenario can be difficult to recreate, hence the extended period of time it took to discover this particle, but the connection between the Higgs boson and the electroweak interaction exists in the role that the Higgs plays in giving mass to the W and Z bosons.</p>

<p>The electroweak force produces 4 massless bosons which are completely different from the particles carrying the two separated forces. According to the <a href="https://www.quantumdiaries.org/2011/11/21/why-do-we-expect-a-higgs-boson-part-i-electroweak-symmetry-breaking/" target="_blank">Quantum Diaries</a>, the W and Z bosons use the Higgs boson to gain mass by “absorbing” it. This action breaks electroweak symmetry and provides a reasonable explanation for why the W and Z bosons have mass and for why the Higgs field exists.</p>

<p><b>The Higgs Mechanism</b>
<br />A simple analogy used to describe the Higgs mechanism is the difference between pushing a large cube across the ground and pushing a large ball on the same surface. The shape of the object represents the resistance caused by the field, and the friction experienced by the objects as they are pushed represents the mass gained from the field’s resistance. You will notice that a large cube is harder to push around than a ball due to the shapes of the objects. The same applies to particles in the Higgs field, where a particle like a photon would be the ball and a particle like a lepton would be the cube. This can be observed, as a photon moving in a vacuum will travel at “c,” (the speed of light), due to its low resistance to the field, which makes it massless. A lepton, however, will move slower and take longer than a photon to reach an equally distanced endpoint due to the lepton having a stronger interaction with the field. To put it simply, certain particles are resisted more than other particles by this field, which is how they “acquire” mass.</p>

<p><b>Conclusion</b>
<br />After almost 50 years of digging and experiments, a powerful factor in modern physics was discovered, helping to pave the way for discoveries in modern theoretical physics. The Higgs field and the Higgs boson seemed to have wrapped a neat little bow around our current understanding of particle physics, strengthening humanity’s knowledge of the physical world.</p>
