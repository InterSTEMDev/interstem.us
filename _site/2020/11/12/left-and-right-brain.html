<p>Joan Joe. 11/13/2020</p>
<hr />

<p><img src="/images/blogs/2020/november/leftRightBrainOne.jpg" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto" /></p>

<p><br />
If you’re like me, you belong to 90 percent of the world’s population of right-handed people. This is often genetically determined, though it isn’t clear why our evolution has led to more righties than lefties. It’s a well-accepted belief that lefties and righties are right and left-brained respectively. However, in keeping with new research, the concept of individuals being either left or right-brained might not be as fixed as once thought.</p>

<p>It is a widely acknowledged fact that most animals have an anatomically and functionally asymmetric brain. A number of the differences are learned and others are inherited. While the dominant side of the brain may be randomly assigned, a large spectrum of possibilities indicates that there could be something more than randomness at work.</p>

<p>Studies conducted on <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2729063/" target="_blank">zebrafish embryos</a> about their developing brain suggest that there can be a fight for dominance between the hemispheres. Researchers have known that neurons migrate long distances in an exceedingly developing brain. This is often controlled by a gene called fibroblast protein 8 (FGF8), which creates a protein that acts as a magnet to draw in nerve cells to one hemisphere of the brain.</p>

<p>There is little difference within the number of cells on each side, but what does differ are the types of neurons on the left and right and their connections. Each side of the brain contains FGF8, resulting in a tug-of-war to draw in certain migrating nerve cells. But this can be an unfair fight. Only on the left side of the brain is another protein, called Nodal, present.</p>

<p>“The pair wins when it teams up with FGF8, causing a repetitive pattern of neuron links within the cerebral hemisphere that helps to clarify why in groups of people there is clear handedness,” Professor Stephen Wilson of University College London and Ph.D. student Jenny Regan explained to <a href="https://www.livescience.com/3261-left-battle-brain-discovered.html" target="_blank">Live Science</a>.</p>

<p><br />

<p><br />
The process of becoming right-brained or left-brained is thanks to a contest between the two sides of the brain. If the rivalry was fair and equal, then half of the population would be left-brained and half would be right-brained. However, because of the signals on the left side of the brain that acts as an advantage, in most cases, it wins.</p>

<p>Most right-handed people process language within the left brain. At the same time, many left-handed people even have language proficiency localized to the left. Some individuals throw a right-handed pitch but write with the left hand. Others have a particular preference that the arm goes on top when folded. Others have a dominant eye. A number of these asymmetries can be genetically determined, reinforced by behavior or randomly assigned to support one or more tug-of-war battles between the two sides of the brain.</p>

<p>In theory, people being left or right-brained is simply a sign of which side of their brain is more dominant. This theory became known due to the psychobiologist and Nobel prize winner Roger W. Sperry within the 1960s. The left hemisphere is more analytical, verbal, logical and orderly than the right-brain. So the right-brained thinkers are known to be more creative free thinkers. The left-brained people may give more attention to details and rule by <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/right-brainleft-brain-right-2017082512222" target="_blank">logic. There is a long-standing myth, associated with <a href="https://www.livescience.com/655-lefty-myths-mysteries-persist.html" target="_blank">Rocky Balboa’s heroics</a> within the ring, that left-handers (who have always made up 10 to 12 percent of the human population) are better fighters. True or not, handedness may well be tied to a war of sorts within the brain.</a></p>

<center><i>The image above shows that there is a functional asymmetry in the brain. This test was conducted with 1011 individuals between the ages of 7 and 29 at resting state under researchers from Beijing Normal University, China. <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0071275#abstract0" target="_blank">(PLOS)</a></i></center>
<p><br />
A number of the functions indeed reside on one part of the brain over others. For example, damage to the front of the brain can be associated with reduced motivation, difficulty planning, and impaired creativity. Meanwhile, the rear of the brain, also known as the occipital cortex, integrates visual information from the attention. So damage to this cortex can cause partial or complete blindness. These are just some samples of how certain parts of the brain are responsible for specific functions. Much of our knowledge of this field of study comes from studying <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/split-brain-syndrome" target="_blank">split-brain</a> patients. So, location does matter.</p>

<p>However, when it comes to individual creativity, there has been little to no evidence that the dominance of the brain plays a role. When comparing an <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0071275" target="_blank">MRI</a> or CT scan of a mathematician and an artist, there is often no observable differences. Math, for instance, requires logical thought so it is usually said to reside within the left-hemisphere, isolated from all the artsy right-brain abilities. But mathematics can be a profoundly creative endeavor, in addition to being logical.</p>

<p>So why is that this myth so popular? It should be because it gives us scientific thanks for speaking about our favorite subjects – ourselves.</p>
