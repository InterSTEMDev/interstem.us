        <p>The InterSTEM Summer Research Program (ISRP) is a ten-week science and engineering program designed to introduce high school students to the entire scientific research process. Combining the expertise of accomplished high school researchers and university professors, ISRP will provide students with experience in reviewing scientific literature, creating and refining a specific research proposal, and delivering oral and written presentations on their findings. ISRP is a great opportunity for high school students to gain their first experience in college-level research, and does not expect prospective students to have any research experience </p>

I been learning classical dance for a long time but am looking to branch out sometime. Currently in India, I am taking the IGCSE curriculum for the rest of 10th, if I stay in India after finishing, I want to apply for the IB curriculum. If I return to the States, I hope to continue my high school there. Either way, I want to go to college in the U.S. and pursue a career in science.<br/>

              <p>Hello, I am a rising sophomore from Northwood High School. I am a member of the Physics club at my high school. Next year, I plan on joining more clubs, including the Machine Learning and Astronomy club. In general, I am interested in practically every STEM topics. I find physics to be especially interesting, although Genetics, Artificial Intelligence, and Math are also very fascinating topics as well. If I continue to be interested in physics, I wish to become a theoretical physicist who works as a researcher, or a physics teacher. Sports that I would either want to watch or play are basketball, table tennis, and other racquet sports. <br/>

In terms of STEM-related interests, I enjoy learning about biological sciences and also psychology, which are two branches that build off the other. I was always fascinated with how the human body and mind worked. That being said, as I grew up, I was still unsure of what I wanted to do in the future. I am set on pursuing something in the field of sciences but have not narrowed it down yet. In terms of personal hobbies, I spend my free time practicing piano, reading, watching anime, and playing Minecraft with my friends and my younger sister. <br/>

              <p>Hi! I'm Shubhi Verma! I was born in India, however, I lived in Tampa, Florida for most of my life. I'm currently a rising junior in high school in India. I find aeronautical sciences and astrophysics quite interesting! I think that going to a STEM based middle magnet school catered a lot to my growing interest in these fields. Apart from that, I recently have gotten into Computer Sciences and Python and Java programming as well. Now coming to my leisure activities, I would say that dance is the biggest one in this category. However for me, dance isn't just a leisure activity, it's one of my strongest passions. I have been dancing since I was 8 years old, and I've trained in Bollywood, Classical, Hiphop, and Jazz Junk styles. My favourite  would be jazz funk because this style enables me to feel most like myself. I've trained from the Arya Dance Academy, The Danceworx Mumbai and Nritya Shakti Mumbai.<br/>

        <br />
        <details>
        <summary>What is the acceptance rate?</summary>
        <p>As this is the first ISRP, there are no past admissions statistics. However, for the year-round InterSTEM Research Program, which lasts from September to April, more than 100 students applied, of which 16 were ultimately accepted. </p>
        </details>
        <details>
        <summary>I have never conducted scientific research. Should I apply?</summary>
        <p>Yes! The ISRP directors do not expect you to have had any prior research experience and will assume that this is your first research project throughout the program. ISRP is a great opportunity for high school students to gain their first experience in college-level research.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
        <summary>What is the time commitment?</summary>
        <p>Students should expect to spend at least 10 hours a week on independent research, in addition to attending all mandatory individual and group meetings. The most successful students will likely devote even more time to their projects.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
        <summary>Is there an application fee?</summary>
        <p>No, not at all.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
        <summary>Is there any program fee?</summary>
        <p>No, aside from any (completely optional) research materials you may choose to purchase.</p>
