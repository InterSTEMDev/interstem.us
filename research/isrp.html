        <p>The InterSTEM Summer Research Program (ISRP) is a ten-week science and engineering program designed to introduce high school students to the entire scientific research process. Combining the expertise of accomplished high school researchers and university professors, ISRP will provide students with experience in reviewing scientific literature, creating and refining a specific research proposal, and delivering oral and written presentations on their findings. ISRP is a great opportunity for high school students to gain their first experience in college-level research, and does not expect prospective students to have any research experience </p>

        <br />
        <details>
        <summary>What is the acceptance rate?</summary>
        <p>As this is the first ISRP, there are no past admissions statistics. However, for the year-round InterSTEM Research Program, which lasts from September to April, more than 100 students applied, of which 16 were ultimately accepted. </p>
        </details>
        <details>
        <summary>I have never conducted scientific research. Should I apply?</summary>
        <p>Yes! The ISRP directors do not expect you to have had any prior research experience and will assume that this is your first research project throughout the program. ISRP is a great opportunity for high school students to gain their first experience in college-level research.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
        <summary>What is the time commitment?</summary>
        <p>Students should expect to spend at least 10 hours a week on independent research, in addition to attending all mandatory individual and group meetings. The most successful students will likely devote even more time to their projects.</p>
