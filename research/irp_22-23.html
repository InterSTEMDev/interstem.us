          <br>
          <p>The InterSTEM Research Program (IRP) is a student-run research program designed to encourage academically motivated high school students to share a platform in which they can conduct scientific research on various topics, including biology, physics, and machine learning. Consisting of multiple teams of 5-6 students, IRP serves as a valuable opportunity for students to collaboratively work on projects and develop practical skillset pertaining to research. No prior research experience is needed in order to participate.</p>

		  <p style="font-size: 16px">
			What is the acceptance rate? <strong>As this is the first ISRP, there are no past admissions statistics. However, for the year-round InterSTEM Research Program, which lasts from September to April, more than 100 students applied, of which 16 were ultimately accepted.</strong> <br> <br>
			I have never conducted scientific research. Should I apply? <strong>Yes! The ISRP directors do not expect you to have had any prior research experience and will assume that this is your first research project throughout the program. ISRP is a great opportunity for high school students to gain their first experience in college-level research. </strong><br><br>
			What is the time commitment? <strong>Students should expect to spend at least 10 hours a week on independent research, in addition to attending all mandatory individual and group meetings. The most successful students will likely devote even more time to their projects. </strong><br><br>
			Is there an application fee?   <strong>No.</strong> <br><br>
			Is there any program fee? <strong>No, aside from any (completely optional) research materials you may choose to purchase. </strong> <br><br>
