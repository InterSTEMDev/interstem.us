In 1950, the blue skies of our native home planet had roughly 300 carbon dioxide (CO‚ÇÇ) molecules per one million regular air molecules (PPM), a number that had never been exceeded in the past 800,000 years. But, this relatively constant carbon dioxide level did not last much longer. Mankind exited an era where nature was still in power, and the tides shifted as humans began to dictate their environment and even the climate. According to the <a href="https://research.noaa.gov/article/ArtMID/587/ArticleID/2636/Rise-of-carbon-dioxide-unabated" target="_blank">National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</a>, a Cavity Ring-Down Spectroscopy (CRDS), which calculates particles of CO‚ÇÇ by measuring the exponential rate of absorption of light in the detector, registered an atmospheric carbon dioxide reading of 417.1 PPM at Mauna Loa in Hawaii, an all-time peak, in May 2020.</p>

<p>The impacts of climate change are being felt worldwide, as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) reports that <a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2817/with-thick-ice-gone-arctic-sea-ice-changes-more-slowly/" target="_blank">two-thirds of all sea ice has melted</a> and that <a href="" target="_blank">global temperatures have increased significantly since the 1880s. Priya Krishnakumar and Swetha Kannan of the Los Angeles Times describe how eight of the ten worst fires in California‚Äôs history have occurred in 2020, and Jonathan Erdman of the Weather Channel reveals that the number of tropical storms in 2020 has tied the previous record held in 1918. With time running out, humans are trying to amend our past mistakes. Organizations and people, such as former Vice President Al Gore, Blue Sky Analytics and CarbonPlan have partnered to unveil a first of its kind real-time carbon emissions tracker called Climate Tracking Real-time Atmospheric Carbon Emissions, or Climate TRACE.</a></p>

<p>Although volcanic eruptions and respirations release carbon dioxide, researchers John Cook and others found a ‚Äú97 [percent] consensus‚Äù among all scientists that human activities are the main cause of rising CO‚ÇÇ levels. The Environmental Protection Agency reports that deforestation, the burning of fossil fuels for industrial and transportation uses and agriculture cause the majority of carbon emissions.</p>

<p>Currently, the United States and Taiwan are two of the few countries that announce plant emissions and power generation for every hour whereas European nations and Australia only report on how much power is generated, not emissions. There is such limited information on emissions as most countries do not have government policies in place or enough money. Aaron Larson also reported that all countries, regardless of wealth, can tamper their data and release unreliable information.</p>

<p>Present methods for obtaining atmospheric data include using CRDS and satellites that measure infrared absorption, but both of these methods utilize outdated technology. The observatories using CRDS are unable to monitor air quality high in the atmosphere, and according to the Atmosphere Monitoring Service, the satellites are prone to poor resolution imaging quality with weather skewing absorption data.</p>

<p>Carbon emissions can only be controlled if they are measured properly, and the current carbon tracking system depends on infrequent, unreliable, and often outdated self-reporting without independent third-party verification. To obtain better data, new technology is required to address these issues.</p>

<p>With Climate TRACE, these problems are solved. According to Climate TRACE software engineer Heather D. Couture, both visible light and thermal infrared will be detected from three Earth satellite networks and radars such as the European Space Agency‚Äôs Sentinel 2 mission; so the prototype system can collect 5,000 heat signatures and images without clouds in them per day. As this is a large amount of data covering various wavelengths and angles, no team of human analysts would be capable of evaluating this information quickly and accurately. So, artificial intelligence and deep learning technology, the same kind used in speech recognition and machine translation, are utilized to rapidly spot patterns concealed in the large mass of facts and figures.</p>

<p>Researchers used historical images combined with plant-reported data to teach the algorithm to identify those patterns. For instance, the AI could predict emissions when it is given an entirely new image of a known plant. To identify the power plants in the first place, the AI searches for visual and thermal signatures, such as a hot flue stack which is a smoke plume released by power plants, a large water vapor plume released by cooling towers nearby generators or hot water released by cooling towers.</p>

<p>Now that technology exists where greenhouse gas emissions can be tracked down to individual ships across the globe quickly and reliably, the world can be held to a higher standard so that climate change can be slowed. With this AI, falsified reporting will be limited, and people will be empowered to do what is right. Although Climate TRACE is not yet perfected, we are within the grasp of, as former Vice President Al Gore said, a ‚Äúnew era of transparency‚Äù.</p>
