<p>Some computer systems are even capable of developing abstract forms of creativity similar to individual thought in the form of meaningful literature and paintings. An example of computer-minded artwork is ‚ÄúEdmond de Belamy‚Äù, a fully AI-generated ‚Äúpainting.‚Äù Through deep learning, AI is able to imitate a creative mind based on previous human work, as seen in the paint strokes and the prominent human figure wearing a suit and collared shirt.  Apart from the visual aspect of art, AI is well capable of creating forms of analytical literature. An open-source artificial intelligence, GPT-2, has created multiple excerpts of poetry and fictional writing.</p>
