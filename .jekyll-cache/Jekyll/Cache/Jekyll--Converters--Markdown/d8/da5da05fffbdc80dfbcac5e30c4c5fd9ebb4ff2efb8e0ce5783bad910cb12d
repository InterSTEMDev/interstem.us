The year was 1924. Barren dirt replaced the characteristic native plants of Yellowstone National Park. Streams running through the plains and forests of the park eroded the land away at an alarming rate. Bird populations flew off to faraway lands, leaving their former home‚Äî now a wasteland‚Äî behind. What could be the cause of this catastrophic decline in the beloved National Park? What sparked this event that <a href="https://www.nrdc.org/issues/protect-keystone-species" target="_blank">National Geographic</a> calls a ‚Äútop-down trophic cascade‚Äù? It turns out the cause of the ecological disaster was the loss of only one species: the grey wolf. The grey wolf happened to be very important because it was a keystone species.</p>

<p>A keystone species is any species that has a niche, or ecological job, so specific that other organisms in its environment cannot fulfill that same role. The <a href="https://www.oursafetynet.org/2020/02/07/what-are-keystone-species/" target="_blank">Canadian National Environmental Treasure</a> notes the term as being first used by ecologist Robert T. Paine. Paine observed the relationship between ochre sea stars and their prey, mussels, and determined that a loss in the ochre sea star population would trigger an uncontrolled growth in the mussel population, which in turn would negatively affect other aspects of the environment. National Geographic notes that other well-known species that serve as keystone species in their environment include grey wolves, salmon and elephants. Keystone species can be found at every level of the food pyramid, from producer to apex predator.</p>

<p>In the case of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, the grey wolf was the only predator of elk. Without the wolves, the elk population exploded. Elk overgrazed the vegetation in Yellowstone, leaving the ground barren and the stream banks lacking the native plants that usually prevented erosion. The elk population took food away from other herbivores and omnivores, leaving them to starve. Just as a keystone keeps an arch from collapsing, the grey wolf kept Yellowstone from collapsing. When the wolves were taken away from Yellowstone, the ecosystem fell apart.</p>

<p>Keystone species may be the most important species in an ecosystem, but they are not always the most aesthetic or well-known creatures. Many people take up rallying cries to save animals considered cute, but few take up the rallying cry to save the lumpy and veined ochre sea star. Despite their adorable appearances, if some popular animals disappeared from the wild, the environmental impact would not be as extreme. Since society collectively does not understand the importance of keystone species, more and more keystone species are becoming endangered while conservation efforts focus on the most popular species. The <a href="https://www.nrdc.org/issues/protect-keystone-species" target="_blank">United States Natural Resources Defense Council</a> (NRDC) also cites human development and the environmental mismanagement of governments as reasons for the decline of keystone species. The NRDC argues that listening to the advice of ecologists on the topic of conservation is the only way forward.</p>

<p>After scientists and the government alike watched the Yellowstone ecosystem collapse, they realized that something had to be done. National Geographic reports that in 1990, nearly seventy years after the top-down trophic cascade in Yellowstone began, the United States government started a program to reintroduce grey wolves to the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. Since then, the ecosystem has sprung back to life. Despite the fact that the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem was in shambles less than thirty years ago, the <a href="https://www.nationalparks.org/explore-parks/yellowstone-national-park" target="_blank">National Park Foundation</a> (NPF) describes present-day Yellowstone as an ‚Äúotherworldly‚Äù and ‚Äútruly unique‚Äù place with ‚Äúplentiful wildlife‚Äù. Visitors to the park are sometimes lucky enough to see one of the keystone species in the distance, as the <a href="https://www.nationalparks.org/our-work/programs/yellowstone-wolf-impact-study" target="_blank">Yellowstone Wolf Impact Study</a> from the NPF reports that the grey wolf population has grown to over 400 individuals, each one helping to hold the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem together. Almost a century later, many species that migrated from the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem have returned. Communities of animals that nearly went extinct are thriving again, their population numbers constant. Plants cover the ground again, feeding animals and holding streams in place. Thanks to the return of its keystone species, the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem is once again intact.</p>

<p>The story of the wolves illustrates the importance of protecting keystone species. If keystone species are not protected and consequently disappear from the world‚Äôs ecosystems, the world‚Äôs environment would shatter. This type of ecological disaster can be avoided if governments work with scientists to prioritize the protection of keystone species. If society begins to understand the importance of keystone species and advocates for their protection, the world can move forward, united against environmental ruin.</p>
