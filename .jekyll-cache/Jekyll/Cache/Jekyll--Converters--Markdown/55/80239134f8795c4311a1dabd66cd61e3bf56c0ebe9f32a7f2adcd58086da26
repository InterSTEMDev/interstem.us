There are <a href="https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Herschel/How_many_stars_are_there_in_the_Universe" target="_blank">tens of billions of galaxies</a> in our observable universe, each containing millions of stars. Scientists estimate that each star has an average of about <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2018/03/13/space-is-full-of-planets-and-most-of-them-dont-even-have-stars/?sh=4ce74893b2a1" target="_blank">ten planets</a>, an approximation calculated just from the planets that have survived throughout the 4.5 billion years of our universe‚Äôs existence. With hundreds of billions of planets, is it really possible that humans are alone in the universe?</p>

<p>Even before there was concrete evidence that could quantify the size of the universe, it was clear how vast it was. Scholars were already incredibly fascinated by the possibilities that lay beyond our planet prior to modern technology. In the 17th century, Galileo used the revolutionary development of the telescope to observe the characteristics of the Milky Way. And in 1923, Edwin Hubble discovered concrete evidence for the existence of galaxies other than the Milky Way. But even with these groundbreaking discoveries, many were left feeling like something was missing. One mystery surfaced above the rest: ‚ÄúWhere is everybody?‚Äù</p>

<p>This dilemma was the reason for Enrico Fermi‚Äôs lunchtime remark that sparked decades of research and speculation. Named after the famous physicist, the Fermi paradox is the contradiction between the high probability for extraterrestrial life and the lack of evidence supporting the existence of aliens. According to the <a href="https://www.seti.org/press-release/how-many-habitable-planets-are-out-there" target="_blank">SETI Institute</a>, as many as 300 million planets may be habitable in just the Milky Way. Billions of planets orbit within the habitable zones of stars and scientists have even discovered several planets that resemble Earth. The Fermi paradox perplexes even the most knowledgeable scientists today, and there is still no viable answer.</p>

<p>Numerous theories debate this paradox, with a few of the most popular speculating that aliens see no reason to visit Earth, they have already visited Earth undetected, we don‚Äôt have the correct technology to contact aliens, or that life itself is unlikely, and the possibility of it developing into intellectual species is even more so.</p>

<p>Dozens of other theories exist, each with its own fair amount of counterarguments and doubt. For over 70 years, researchers and scientists have published papers and debated the viability of various theories. One method that scientists rely on when debating the Fermi paradox is the <a href="" target="_blank">Drake Equation</a>. Developed in the 1960s, it calculates the number of civilizations in the Milky Way galaxy of which humans could theoretically communicate with. The Drake Equation multiples together evidential factors, like the number of planets per solar system that can support life, and hypothetical ones, such as the length of time that these civilizations actually release detectable signals into space. However, the indefinite nature of both the Fermi paradox and any attempts to supplement the issue means that any papers published can only be, at best, regarded as speculation.</p>

<p>Each new decade brings more and more uncertainty about the possibility of life outside of Earth. Even with new technologies capable of taking pictures of stars as far as 3.79 billion miles away from Earth, humans are unable to find any evidence supporting the possibility of extraterrestrial life. Despite this discouraging amount of progress, many scientists stand by their belief that aliens do indeed exist. But whether or not scientists can find conclusive evidence of extraterrestrial civilizations, humanity will surely continue to explore deeper into space and uncover the mystery of our own existence.</p>
