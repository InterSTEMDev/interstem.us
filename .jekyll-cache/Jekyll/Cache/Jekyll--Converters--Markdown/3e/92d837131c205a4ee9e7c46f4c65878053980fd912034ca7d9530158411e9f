Bill Kochevar never thought he would be able to feed himself again. After a tragic biking incident, Kochevar was paralyzed from his neck down. For many years, he couldn’t even scratch an itch himself: he depended totally on caregivers. But in 2017, researchers at Case Western University developed an electromechanical system that mimicked Kochevar’s spinal cord. At the end of the study, he was able to grab a mug of water, drink through a straw and scratch his nose with a sponge. Through two arrays of sensors in his brain and electrodes in his right arm, Kochevar saw the impossible happen.</p>
