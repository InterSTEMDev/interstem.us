‚ÄúMixing‚Äù vaccines may boost our immunity against COVID-19. <a href="https://www.clinicaltrialsarena.com/analysis/covid-19-vaccine-mixing-the-good-the-bad-and-the-uncertain/" target="_blank">(Clinical Trials Arena)</a>

The COVID-19 pandemic has lasted for over a year now, and many different brands of vaccines have been created in response to the coronavirus, such as the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Oxford-AstraZeneca and Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccines. Even though not federally approved yet, the idea of mixing and matching these vaccines is gaining popularity as there is significant evidence that doing so strengthens the immune system. This ‚Äúmix and match‚Äù method of administering vaccines can also be referred to as heterologous vaccination, which means that an individual receives one type of vaccine for their first shot and then another type for their second shot.</p>

<p>To better understand how this mixing approach utilizes different ‚Äútypes‚Äù of shots to strengthen the immune system, a brief overview of the human immune system is necessary. The human immune system has two main lines of defense: antibodies and T cells. Antibodies are proteins made by the immune system that bind to virus particles and ‚Äúdeactivate‚Äù them before they can infect any cells. T cells get rid of cells that have already been infected.</p>

<p>Most vaccines currently focus on the antibody line of the immune system and something on the coronavirus‚Äô surface called a spike protein. The spike protein is what defines the coronavirus, so if your body is able to recognize the spike protein, it is able to recognize the coronavirus. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines deliver mRNA, a set of instructions for the cell, to the ribosomes, where the cells can then recreate the spike protein. After the spike protein is completed, the body is able to recognize that the spike protein is a foreign object and starts building up a memory-like response to it with antibodies. On the other hand, Johnson &amp; Johnson and Oxford-AstraZeneca notify the cell about the coronavirus‚Äô spike protein by delivering another virus (an adenovirus) that has the spike protein ‚Äúhidden‚Äù on it. The problem with using this Trojan horse-like contraption is that the immune system builds up immunity to the delivery molecule, in this case the adenovirus, which means that subsequent vaccinations will be less effective. Regardless of how they transfer the spike protein to our immune systems and the relative efficacy of their methods, the Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson &amp; Johnson and Astra-Zeneca vaccines all protect our immune systems from their coronavirus by focusing on getting our cells to recognize the coronavirus‚Äô spike protein.</p>

The coronavirus‚Äô spike protein is located on the exterior of the cell like a nametag that lets other cells recognize it. The instructions for the spike protein are found in the RNA in the coronavirus‚Äô nucleus.
