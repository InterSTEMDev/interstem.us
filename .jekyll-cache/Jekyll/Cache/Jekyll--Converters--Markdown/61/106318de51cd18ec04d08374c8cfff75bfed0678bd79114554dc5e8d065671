As of Aug. 4, 2020, a study from the University of Sydney found that COVID-19 transmission rates between children and children to adults were low in New South Wales schools and early educational settings, such as preschools and pre-kindergarten.</p>

<p>Researchers from the National Centre for Immunization Research and Surveillance (NCIRS) worked with the University of Sydney to examine data from January to April of 2020. The group, led by Professor Kristine Macartney, looked at twenty-five various locations, including fifteen schools and ten childcare/daycare centers. According to Macartney, “COVID-19 transmission in schools appears to be considerably less than that seen for other respiratory viruses, such as influenza.”</p>

<p>This is good news for Americans as schools reopen, because it means that— when done properly— children can return to school safely. Macartney cites contact tracing, routine cleaning, and temporary closures if a member of the school contract COVID-19 as effective procedures to keep transmission rates low. Other data concerning COVID-19 shows that overall, the disease has a lower transmission and milder effect overall in the younger population. This is seen in the fact that out of 1333 primary and high schools the University and NCIRS studied, only five secondary infections were recorded, meaning COVID-19 had a .04 percent transmission rate in the settings, according to <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/08/200804100225.htm" target="_blank">Science Daily</a>. The study is ongoing, and researchers are still collecting transmission data for the July to September block.</p>

<p>Australia’s response to COVID-19 after learning of the case in Wuhan, China on Jan. 25, 2020 was different from the US’s. The country surveyed incoming travelers and communities, tested frequently and aggressively, isolated cases, and performed contact tracing. They also closed their borders and put an immediate quarantine in place. However, Australia has kept their schools open throughout the pandemic, with measures in place to help prevent the spread, closing finally on March 23, 2020, at the peak of the pandemic. They did keep early child education and care open for children ages six weeks to five years.</p>

<p>Even before the outbreak, Australia “has done a fair amount of preparation and had the mechanisms in place,” says Dr. Lesley Russel, an Associate Professor at the Menzies Centre for Health Policy, in an interview for Business Insider on Australia’s pandemic response. They have a well-funded infection monitoring system, and the state and federal government has cooperated during this time.</p>

<p>By comparison, the US has, in recent years, cut funding for the CDC, which is lacking resources and money. Russel says the Trump administration has utilized a “just in time” response, which may be an attempt to help prevent the economy from falling apart.</p>

<p>Australia’s response to the pandemic has not been politicized, and politicians have let the scientists gauge the situation and appropriate responses. The U.S. government did hold daily briefings on updates about the pandemic, but they fell into disarray as facts were skewed, reporters were berated, and past actions were called into question.</p>

<p>We need to look at Australia as an example of what is possible in these times, and to know that, with proper safety measures, children can go back to schools. While America cannot change its actions in the past in terms of how we have handled the pandemic, moving forward, we need unified, confident, and effective methods to maintain safety while reopening. This study done by the University of Sydney can give us a look into the long-term effectiveness of quarantining compared to keeping certain settings open, and it can give us security as the school year starts.</p>

<p>As schools reopen, studies show the transmission rates of COVID-19 are low, with proper distancing and safety requirements.</p>
