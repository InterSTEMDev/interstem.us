<center><i>Groundbreaking research shows humans’ innate desire for connections with others is surprisingly similar to hunger cravings.

Just as hungry brains crave food, lonely brains crave people, new research suggests. This interesting connection between the two types of deprivation is increasingly important as COVID-19 isolates us all, demonstrating how social distancing can have detrimental effects on our lonely brains.</p>

<p>Livia Tomova and her team at MIT created an <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-020-00742-z" target="_blank">experiment</a> to test the cognitive response to cravings. Participants volunteered to go without food for 10 hours so Tomova could determine which nerve cells responded to the need for food. Certain neurotransmitters became excited at the sight of junk food, and the neurons subsequently released dopamine as a positive reaction. This happy chemical is released frequently as a type of reward for the human brain.</p>

<p>Based on this initial segment of the experiment, Tomova wanted to test exactly how the brain responds to social deprivation, and how it differed from food deprivation. The same subjects were placed in a room entirely alone for 10 hours. After the isolation time ended, Tomova exposed the subjects to pictures of people and social gatherings. The subjects’ brains were immediately activated and produced dopamine, the same chemical that indicates a reward. In other words, they responded almost identically to the need for food as to the need for human contacts, indicating a fundamental connection between the two necessities.</p>

<p>For some subjects, the loneliness was more difficult, and this was reflected in their neural response to the hours of isolation. Others reported that the experience was not nearly as challenging for them, as it reflected their daily lifestyle. Therefore, environmental impacts such as general isolation or loneliness throughout life can make a human brain more accustomed to the feeling, thus not feeling much of a reward when exposed to social situations. Similarly, people tolerate hunger differently, since some generally have a greater tolerance for pain, which can come from a lack of food. They may feel the hunger on varying degrees, in the same way they experience loneliness, so people should remember that everyone’s circumstances in COVID-19 are inconsistent.</p>

<p>A thought to keep in mind, however, is that those who have stronger wills to combat suffering may still be in pain, although it may not be obvious to others. During COVID-19, all people should still receive empathy for the loneliness they may be feeling, since they can still be hurting at the same degree as those that express their feelings more. It is important to remember that a coping mechanism for many is to push their struggles deep inside and ignore that something is missing in their lives, which may give others the illusion that they are unaffected by these times.</p>

<p>The physiological connection between the need for food and social interactions demonstrates how humans’ brains react similarly when we are deprived of certain needs that our bodies require. Tomova’s experiment reflects how people’s brains are different from those of other individuals and therefore have varying responses to isolation. But overall, the deprivation of social connections can have an adverse effect on the brain as dopamine is an essential chemical to positive mental health.</p>

<p>Tomova stressed the importance of being understanding in our current time, as isolation can put mental and physical health at stake, so everyone should respect the situations of others, as isolation impacts everyone in various ways.</p>
