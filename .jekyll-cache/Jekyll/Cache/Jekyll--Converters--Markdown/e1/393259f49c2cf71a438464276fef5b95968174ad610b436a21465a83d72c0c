Climate change is pushing new boundaries as dangerously high temperatures suggest an entirely new climate system is emerging in the Northern pole. According to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-020-0892-z.epdf?sharing_token=FtYt7dQsxgKZ-glVzsT7U9RgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0MqVMypMyE7pAbPE1tu481cfXA0d4GjqhJeVhIB88dZZJi1abe22TQZDvIoxlpfXD-yndBKgUoVFuPC-jto2hvBoIFE8jjwIiZ62S7k2DdoXoqOS1Vpq2NwPIh2JOn443IgUz4QPzUEPSMrk-2XN17vWSCWzIJ1rf9GMd3roXQ0uhi9sUofO3q5QEPd7eL_HwcxBXWoHIR59wvGfVxwcaGGrUDfeXFxmChn9OWPZqDltCpS4CEduy2BNjiDAppQNmrl_Bbz1SaG8jeaNdvYBm9s&amp;tracking_referrer=www.scientificamerican.com" target="_blank">research</a> from the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), this Arctic climate system is forming as the Northern Hemisphere sea-ice extents have ‚Äúbeen lower in each of the past 13 years than any other years since 1980, as new research displays.‚Äù</p>

<p>In the next decade, scientists predict that climate change may reach a point where it is unstoppable. Laura Landrum and Marika Holland, researchers at the NCAR in Colorado, made their recent findings about Arctic conditions public in their journal, &lt;a href=‚Äù‚Äù target=‚Äù_blank‚Äù.Nature Climate Change. Due to such significant and rapid alterations in the climate patterns, a completely new climate best describes the current conditions of the Arctic.</p>

<p>Various climate models depicted in Landrum and Holland‚Äôs report indicate that this new Arctic has already emerged. Due to the increasing rate of human-produced carbon emissions and other contributing biological factors, sea ice has already declined more than anyone would have believed 30 years ago. On its own, this crucial layer prevents the ocean from heating up quickly. When this ice layer thins or disappears, water temperature increases, thereby starting the cycle of melting ice again and continuing the positive feedback loop.</p>

<p>Climate change is upon us, and the actions taken in the next decade are crucial to slowing it down before it reaches a point where temperatures increase at an exponential rate. At that point‚Äî which draws nearer everyday‚Äî humanity‚Äôs survival is at stake, since increased sea levels can threaten people‚Äôs security and safety. Additionally, the fate of oceanic and land organisms is threatened, since higher ocean temperatures and ocean acidification are deadly to various animals. Fish can become more sensitive to the increasing temperatures and lose available breeding grounds and overall habitat. Ocean acidification occurs as the ocean absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and is gradually shifting from a basic ph to a more neutral ph. For marine life, even fractions of a change in ph can be deadly. As the ocean absorbs CO2, there are fewer carbonate ions in the water, which makes it harder for coral‚Äôs calcium carbonate skeletons to develop. For ecosystems such as coral reefs, the absence or bleaching of coral can cause entire ecosystems to collapse.</p>

<p>Oceanic ecosystems will topple without the presence of key organisms. As climate change causes temperatures to rise and transform the global climate, ecosystems are suffering and dangerous new climates are emerging. It is crucial to reduce carbon emissions in a collective effort to lessen the future devastating effects of climate change.</p>
