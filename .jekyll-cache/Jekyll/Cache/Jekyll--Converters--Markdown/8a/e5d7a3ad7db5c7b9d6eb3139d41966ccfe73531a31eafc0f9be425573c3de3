<p><b>What is time dilation?</b>
Einsteinâ€™s theory of relativity suggested a new outlook of space-time itself. He described time as modified; rather than time being a constant moving parameter, it moves relative to an objectâ€™s path. Time can be warped or changed by high gravitational forces and immense speeds. Essentially, speed and force can alter the fabric of space-time entirely. Timewarp predominantly causes time to slow down or speed up in the observerâ€™s perspective, which is otherwise known as time dilation.</p>
