It is a symbol of good: the yellow ring that encompasses an individual‚Äôs head is traditionally used to symbolize holiness, glory, reverence and other positive attributes. Not only are these bright rings of light called halos, but halos are also what NASA scientists use to describe distinct shells of gas that surround the Andromeda galaxy.</p>

<p>This galaxy, also known as M31, is an entity with around 1 trillion stars and is the closest galaxy to our Milky Way. It is an elliptical galaxy and was discovered by Edwin Hubble in 1925 when he discovered a star within the massive cloud of particles. It is around 2.5 million light-years from us, a distance that although may seem astronomical, is very, very close in comparison to other space objects. The halo, which scientists are comprehensively studying right now, is not visible to the naked eye. However, if it was, it would look similar to a giant smudge within the night sky. It would likely be a blue or purple hue shining across the deep blue night. The gaseous halo, although cool looking, is the catalyst of scientific research at American universities. Yale University and the University of Notre Dame are zooming in closely to the gas puddle, as it potentially holds lots of answers to the questions people have about the Milky Way‚Äôs closest neighbor. The gas contained within the galaxy is the host of future-star particles; in this sense, researchers may be able to ‚Äúpredict‚Äù any new star formation activity. The gas also reveals the history of the galaxy, and with knowledge on the specific formation of Andromeda, we may be able to predict more about our own home.</p>

<p>From what researchers have observed, they‚Äôve noticed a big difference between the properties of the ‚Äúouter‚Äù halo versus the ‚Äúinner‚Äù halo. According to <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2020/hubble-maps-giant-halo-around-andromeda-galaxy/" target="_blank">Nicolas Lehner</a>, a researcher from the University of Notre Dame, their team found that ‚Äúfind[ing] the inner shell that extends to about a half-million light-years is far more complex and dynamic,‚Äù and the outer shell is a little less chaotic, exhibiting smooth, hot characteristics. To further study the specific areas of halo gas within Andromeda, researchers assembled a project known as Absorption Map of Ionized Gas in Andromeda (AMIGA) to trace absorptions of light coming from different sectors of gas. With these measurements, the size and age of Andromeda can be more accurately calculated.</p>

<p>The researchers are determined to use this beautiful piece of space to determine further order for our galaxy, all while publishing breathtaking photos the Hubble telescope has taken.</p>
