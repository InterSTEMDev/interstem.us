Uncovering the low demand for monoclonal antibody treatments for COVID-19
With the vaccination process beginning a few weeks ago, the approval and use of monoclonal antibodies for treating COVID-19 is still new to many. Many people were not fully aware of the development of these drugs until President Donald Trump received an experimental antibody cocktail earlier in October.</p>

<p>An antibody is a protein that is used by the immune system to recognize and neutralize antigens, any substances the body identifies as foreign. And monoclonal antibodies are created in labs by cloning a white blood cell.</p>
