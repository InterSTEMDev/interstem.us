Being one of the most popular computer science fields, machine learning (ML) has come a long way since its inception back in the 1940s. It has been expanding ever since then and will likely continue to do so. But wait, what is ML? According to IBM, it ‚Äúfocuses on applications that learn from experience and improve their decision-making or predictive accuracy over time.‚Äù ML is a branch of the much bigger artificial intelligence (AI) field in both computer science and technology in general, and it has a central focus on algorithms. The better the algorithm, the more efficient the ML will be in the future.

Despite the field‚Äôs inception technically being in the 1940s, it did not truly start becoming the ML we know today until the 1950s. To be more specific, 1956 marked the year of the Dartmouth Workshop, which has been credited countless times as ‚Äúthe birthplace of AI‚Äù over the years. During this workshop, 20 of the most intelligent minds in computer and cognitive science were brought together to work on a project seeking to uncover the degree to which computers and other machinery could push themselves. The event lasted approximately seven weeks and acted as one giant brainstorming session to figure out ways to push computers to their full potential.

Some outcomes of this workshop included John McCarthy (the event‚Äôs main organizer) coining the term ‚Äòartificial intelligence‚Äô during the conference and Arthur Samuels (one of the intelligent minds) eventually coining the term ‚Äòmachine learning‚Äô three years later in 1959. Samuels would go on to create the Samuel Checkers-playing program, which was one of the world‚Äôs first self-learning programs. Other outcomes involved Herbert Simon and Allen Newell (more of the intelligent minds) showing off Logic Theorist, which was the first program designed to copy the problem-solving skills of a human being after observing them in action and committing them to memory.

Even though the Dartmouth Workshop was centered around the advancement of AI, it had numerous outcomes, one of these being the creation of ML. Thus, the event not only was the birthplace of AI, but it was also technically the birthplace of ML as well. From there, the ML field continued its ever-growing expansion, eventually reaching another milestone during the 1980s and 1990s. This milestone was a change of focus from gaining more knowledge (which was ML‚Äôs main purpose before) to a new approach centered around data. This new paradigm would make it so computers would learn from batches of data, rather than storing them.

This new approach in the ML field was mainly centered around neural networks and support vector machines (SVM), with the former being the bigger focus. While the term ‚Äòneural networks‚Äô may seem daunting at first, it actually is not too hard to understand. Essentially, a neural network is a bundle of neurons all clumped together that work towards a specific goal. When it comes to ML, that ‚Äòspecific goal‚Äô is making sure computers and other machinery can take various groups of data and learn from them.
