According to the <a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/alzheimers-disease-fact-sheet" target="_blank">National Institutes of Health</a> (NIH), <a href="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/what-is-alzheimers" target="_blank">Alzheimerâ€™s disease</a> is the most prevalent type of dementia, affecting more than 5.5 million Americans. Abnormal protein accumulation, called amyloid plaques and tau tangles, steadily kill brain cells and the connections between them in the brains of people with Alzheimerâ€™s, hindering the capacity of individuals to think and remember. The effects are permanent, and there is no treatment yet for Alzheimerâ€™s. To find one, scientists worldwide are working in high gear, but most medicines that have entered clinical trials have failed.

There are two types of Alzheimerâ€™s: early-onset and late-onset.</p>

<p>Typically, <a href="https://www.alz.org/help-support/i-have-alz/younger-onset" target="_blank">early-onset Alzheimerâ€™s</a> affects individuals before age 65, with the signs typically occurring in a personâ€™s 40s or 50s. According to <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alzheimers-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20350447" target="_blank">Mayo Clinic</a>, this type of disorder is rare, affecting only 5% of all people with Alzheimerâ€™s. It is a direct result of hereditary mutations in one of the three genes: APP, PSEN1 or PSEN2. What researchers have discovered from these unusual mutations that cause early-onset Alzheimerâ€™s is that the mutation of the gene leads to the overproduction of a rogue, harmful beta-amyloid protein. <a href="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/what-is-alzheimers/brain_tour" target="_blank">The beta-amyloid</a> build-up in the brain develops plaques that are one of the diseaseâ€™s hallmarks. Just as plaques in the arteries can affect the heart, plaques in the brain can have dire effects on the function of the brain. For the disease to manifest, a person needs to inherit only one of these genes from one parent.</p>

However, the vast majority of Alzheimerâ€™s cases are the <a href="https://www.webmd.com/alzheimers/guide/alzheimers-types" target="_blank">late-onset</a> type, which usually affects individuals over 65 years of age. Alzheimerâ€™s late-onset condition is not usually inherited; instead, it is likely to be derived from a combination of genetic, environmental and lifestyle causes. It is believed that a mutation in a gene called ApoE raises the likelihood of a person developing late-onset Alzheimerâ€™s, but does not cause it. According to the <a href="https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/APOE" target="_blank">NIH</a>, ApoE affects how cholesterol flows through the blood. Research indicates that there is an increased risk of developing Alzheimerâ€™s in people with elevated blood pressure and high cholesterol. Radiation, concussions, injuries and exposure to some contaminants are possible environmental factors.</p>

<p>So, what is the cause of Alzheimerâ€™s disease?</p>

<p>Headlines of revolutionary news have reverberated through the network in recent years- Alzheimerâ€™s disease is not just a disease, itâ€™s an infection.</p>

<p>The hypothesis that bacterial or viral infections could play a role in Alzheimerâ€™s development was unpopularized until about a year ago. However, recently, as scientists have worked out potential pathways for how an infection could lead to the development of these irregular protein buildups in the brain, this concept has gained traction.</p>

<p>Researchers announced the discovery of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porphyromonas_gingivalis" target="_blank">Porphyromonas gingivalis</a> â€“ the pathogen behind <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_periodontitis" target="_blank">chronic periodontitis</a>, or gum disease â€“ in the brains of deceased Alzheimerâ€™s patients, in a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6357742/" target="_blank">paper</a> led by senior author Jan Potempa, a microbiologist from the University of Louisville. Although experts are still trying to isolate the exact causes of this illness, a litany of papers argues that the deadly spread of Alzheimerâ€™s goes far beyond what we used to think.</p>

<p>The report that spurred the headlines was published in the journal <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aau3333" target="_blank">Science Advances</a>. It was reported that gum disease could be a cause of Alzheimerâ€™s. Itâ€™s not the first time that the two variables have been <a href="" target="_blank">related</a>, but the researchers have gone further. Oral infection with the pathogen led to brain colonization by bacteria in separate experiments with mice, along with increased development of amyloid-beta (AÎ²), a sticky protein usually associated with Alzheimerâ€™s. Additionally, in the brains of Alzheimerâ€™s patients, the team identified toxic enzymes called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingipain" target="_blank">gingipains</a> secreted by bacteria. But these tests were conducted after the patients have been deceased. In other words, although P. gingivalis and the disease have been related before, it has never been known whether gum disease causes Alzheimerâ€™s, or whether dementia leads to poor oral treatment.</p>

</i></center>
<p><br />
The researchers write <a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/1/eaau3333" target="_blank">in their paper</a> that their discovery of gingipain antigens in the brains of people with  AD and also with AD pathology indicates that a P. gingivalis brain infection is not a consequence of late-stage disease, but rather an early occurrence. This may explain the pathology observed before cognitive impairment in middle-aged people.</p>

<p>Many experiments have been performed on mice looking at late-stage Alzheimerâ€™s; some have been successful, some have not. <a href="https://www.cortexyme.com" target="_blank">Cortexyme</a>, a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, is currently advancing its lead therapeutic candidate, <a href="https://www.cortexyme.com/pipeline/" target="_blank">Atuzaginstat (COR388)</a>, in the <a href="https://gaintrial.com/en/" target="_blank">GAIN Trial</a> (an ongoing Phase 2/3 clinical trial in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimerâ€™s disease). In experiments with mice, COR388 showed that it could minimize the bacterial load of existing brain infection with P. gingivalis while also reducing the development of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloid_beta" target="_blank">amyloid-beta</a> and neuroinflammation (inflammation of the nervous tissue).</p>

<p>However, in humans, even the successful ones have failed. From 1998 to 2017, there were around 146 unsuccessful attempts to develop Alzheimerâ€™s medications, and another half-dozen or so were <a href="http://phrma-docs.phrma.org/files/dmfile/AlzheimersSetbacksSteppingStones_FINAL_digital.pdf" target="_blank">registered</a> in 2018. A drug, <a href="https://www.alzforum.org/therapeutics/crenezumab" target="_blank">Crenezumab</a> seemed successful, but the interim review indicated that the drug was unlikely to reach the primary endpoint of the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) Score improvement from baseline. So the tests conducted in mice shouldnâ€™t yet be considered as proof that it is a cause.</p>

<p>Many scientists in this area expect that they will soon discover that the causes of Alzheimerâ€™s are vast. While most medications that have been developed to target Alzheimerâ€™s have failed early in clinical trials, there are still many trials underway, and more to come in the future. Scientists expect that they will soon discover that Alzheimerâ€™s causes are many and believe that we are entering the golden age of Alzheimerâ€™s research.</p>

<p>So what can we do?</p>

<p>According to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/aging/aginginfo/alzheimers.htm" target="_blank">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>, there is growing evidence that physical, mental and social behaviors decrease the likelihood of developing Alzheimerâ€™s. The ability to reliably track memory and other cognitive functions in later life is a crucial factor in avoiding the onset of impairment of Alzheimerâ€™s and other dementias. <a href="https://www.cambridgecognition.com/products/digital-healthcare-technology/cantab-mobile/" target="_blank">CANTAB Mobile</a> is a diagnostic software available to GPs that is easy to use to objectively test memory in older adults who are concerned about their risk of dementia. For now, individuals should lead a healthier lifestyle to lower their risk of contracting the disease.</p>
