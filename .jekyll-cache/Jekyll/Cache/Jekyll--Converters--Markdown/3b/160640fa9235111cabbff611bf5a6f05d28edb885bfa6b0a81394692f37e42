<center><i>Languages can all be connected to one another utilizing a “tree” as a visual representation. From here, we can see how the Romance languages, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, French, and Catalan, as well as other minor ones, stem from the same branch.

There’s no doubt that in today’s fast paced, multicultural, connected world, it’s beneficial to know more than one language. Over half the world– estimated to be between 60 and 75%– speak at least two languages, according to Gaia Vince from BBC’s Future. In fact, our brains have evolved to understand multiple languages, to look for clues and to decipher foreign words we have seldom encountered. Language is a complex combination of sounds and symbols that all come together to represent a group of people connected by culture, and, if one follows the signs, they can unlock a world of understanding.</p>

<p>Latin is a unique language to learn because it is no longer spoken, only written and read. We can trace thousands of our words back to their Latin roots and witness the long-lasting presence of the Romans in our governmental structure, art and literature.</p>

<p>This brings me to today, where I sat down with Latin teacher Dr. Jeffrey Feland, a faculty member of Sage Hill School in Newport, CA. He works with students in Latin classes one through four, runs the Junior Classical League, a club that participates in annual challenges and competitions and is a favorite amongst the students. A common theme that emerged from our interview was how important patterns are to a language, and he explained how seeing them helped him excel in his learning.</p>

<p><b>Reagan Smith</b>: So starting off, how many languages do you know, and what are they?</p>

<p><b>Jeffrey Feland</b>: Well, I would say I know Latin and Ancient Greek, but I’ve never had to speak to others in them. Then, I can understand, read and speak Spanish and know basic conversational Italian, French and German. I feel fairly fluent in modern Greek– but then of course that brings up the question of how to define “fluency.”</p>

<p>RS: Of course. So in total, that’s eight languages, including English, obviously. Wow, that’s a lot. How did you begin learning your first foreign language, and what pushed you to become fluent?</p>

<p>JF: At the end of your 7th-grade year, your teacher can recommend you to take high-school classes during the summer before 8th grade, and there was the option for Algebra 1 and Spanish 1. Now I only got the recommendation to do Algebra 1, and I went to my language arts teacher in 7th grade, being the precocious 12 year old I was, and asked why I didn’t get a recommendation to do Spanish 1, even though I had A’s in her class. She told me to my face that she didn’t feel that my English skills were strong enough and that I would never be good at a foreign language, in her opinion.</p>

<p>RS: That’s shocking, considering you now know eight languages.</p>

<p>JF: Yes, I was stunned, and I didn’t know how to respond, so I just assumed that she was right, coming from a place of authority. Eventually, during freshman year I was in my Spanish 1 class. I remember feeling pretty disoriented the first month in that class, but then one day I looked at everything on the page and thought, “This is just patterns. I can just repeat patterns and rules again and again.” Spanish is a pretty straightforward language, so if you learn the rules for it and how the sounds change, you can predict words you’ve never heard before. I started teaching myself all fourteen verb tenses, and on the back of my tests, I would take a random verb and conjugate it into a chart that would take up the whole piece of paper. My teacher finally asked me, “who taught you this; why are you in Spanish 1– this is, like, everything.” I said to her, “I just figured it was patterns.” They moved me up to Spanish 2, where I had the highest grade in the class, and I decided I had one thing left to do freshman year, which was to revisit my 7th grade language teacher. I told her, “Remember how you told me Spanish 1 would be really hard for me and I would struggle? Well, that first month was pretty hard, but then something clicked, they moved me up to Spanish 2, and I’m acing every test. I wanted to tell you to never tell another student they would be bad at a foreign language because that is not how to encourage a student.” Everybody can do a foreign language, you just have to have the right teacher.</p>

<p>RS: Where did you go from there, a freshman in Spanish 2?</p>
