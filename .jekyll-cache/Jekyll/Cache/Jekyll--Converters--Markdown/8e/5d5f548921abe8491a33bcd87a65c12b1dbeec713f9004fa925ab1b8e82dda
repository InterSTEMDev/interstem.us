We usually associate crying with those who are vulnerable or those who are too helpless to help themselves. Babies and small children, who are notorious for bursting straight into tears whenever they are presented with any sort of upsetting situation, usually come to mind. But this is understandable—they cry to communicate since their limited capacity of language falls short. However, even when you’ve grown well past that age and you’re expected to solve your problems with words and actions instead of sitting and weeping about them, you might still find yourself sitting and weeping every now and then. The question today is why shedding tears is our bodies’ natural response to various events in our lives. What exactly makes human beings cry?</p>
