<p>Since the dawn of time, our universe has been governed by four fundamental forces that help physicists explain the universe. The first of these forces to be discovered, and the weakest, is gravity. Gravity is known by most as a force that pulls light objects towards heavy objects. Since it was first theorized by Isaac Newton in 1687, its principle has been further developed through quantum mechanics, and Albert Einsteinâ€™s theory of general relativity.</p>

<p>The second weakest force, electromagnetism, is the force that governs the interactions of charged particles and magnetic fields. It is carried by the photon, and it is responsible for attractive and repulsive forces in charged atoms, chemical reactions, and other phenomena related to energy.</p>

<p>The strong nuclear force is the force that binds quarks together using gluon energy and binds protons to neutrons. It explains why the mass of an atomâ€™s nucleus is slightly smaller than the mass of its protons and neutrons combined, as some of the mass of the subatomic particles is converted into binding energy, as proven by the theory of special relativity.</p>

<p>Finally, there is the weak nuclear force, which acts on subatomic levels and went undiscovered until 1983. You might be wondering what the purpose of this force is and why it is fundamental to our understanding of the universe.</p>
