Apple’s iPhones are currently competing with mobile phones from other countries, such as Huawei from China and Samsung from South Korea.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeQnQ-vjtuY" target="_blank">(YouTube)</a>

Apple is the top mobile phone brand in the United States, with approximately 65% of the national market share. However, this statistic is not necessarily representative of the global market, as records from 2020 show that Apple ranked third in the global smartphone market with 13% of the market share. Samsung, placing second, claimed 19%, while the leading company, Huawei, held 20%. These rankings still stand in 2021, and as Apple, Huawei and Samsung continue to compete for consumers, the spotlight falls on a product that they all have in common: the smartphone.
Arguably the most iconic smartphone brand in the world, Apple released its newest iPhone, the iPhone 12 Pro Max, on Nov. 13, 2020. The iPhone 12 Pro is powered by Apple’s newest chip, the A14 Bionic, which is the first 5-nanometer chip in the microchip industry featuring a grand total of 11.8 billion transistors. The camera sensors (named the Pro camera system) are also 47% larger than the ones of the previous iPhone. In addition to its larger size, the featured cameras include a new 65 mm telephoto lens and 5X optical zoom range that uses Deep Fusion and Neural Engine to analyze multiple exposures pixel by pixel to bring out unprecedented detail in the photos it takes. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are also used - machine learning helps separate the subject from the background in photos.</p>
