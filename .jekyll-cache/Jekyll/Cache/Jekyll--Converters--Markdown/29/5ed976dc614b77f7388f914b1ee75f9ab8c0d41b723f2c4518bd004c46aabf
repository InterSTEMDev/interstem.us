Bill Kochevar never thought he would be able to feed himself again. After a tragic biking incident, Kochevar was paralyzed from his neck down. For many years, he couldn’t even scratch an itch himself: he depended totally on caregivers. But in 2017, researchers at Case Western University developed an electromechanical system that mimicked Kochevar’s spinal cord. At the end of the study, he was able to grab a mug of water, drink through a straw and scratch his nose with a sponge. Through two arrays of sensors in his brain and electrodes in his right arm, Kochevar saw the impossible happen.</p>

<p>Kochevar is one of only 24 people around the world who have received sensors implanted into their brain to aid with paralysis. But given that up to 500,000 people suffer from spinal cord injuries each year according to the World Health Organization (WHO), and even more suffer from neurological diseases and mental illnesses, brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) bear incredible healing potential. They may even make our daily lives far more convenient, both for the patients and those who interact with them.</p>

<p>There are many varieties of BCIs, from the electrode system that helped Kochevar regain function in his arm to circuits that help the user control technology with their brain, all the way to AI-equipped super brains currently under development.</p>

<p>A research paper conducted by Stanford University showed the progress of neural interfaces that are able to allow people to type on a screen using brain signals. In the study, three participants with limb weakness were able to type at a rate of eight words per minute through one to two arrays of electrodes that were inserted into their brains. The electrodes were able to receive signals from the participants’ motor cortex and transmitted them to a nearby computer. The computer then translated the data into point-and-click commands, enabling the participants to move the cursor to click on keys.</p>

<p>Another study by Pittsburgh University aimed to give Nathan Copeland’s sense of touch back in his arm. Copeland was 18 years old when he was in a car accident that rendered him paralyzed and unable to feel his lower half. Copeland had two electrode arrays implanted into his somatosensory cortex (which embeds sensation) and two other electrodes positioned in the motor cortex (which controls hand and arm movement). They linked a robotic arm to the neural interface and programmed it such that Copeland could feel anything that touched the robotic arm on his own arm. The research team electrically stimulated these regions, and as a result, Copeland was able to feel the sensations, including which fingers were being touched and the regions of those fingers. Mr. Copeland described them as “weird,” “electrical tingly” but also “amazing.”</p>

<p>Broadly speaking, BCIs use brain signals to enhance the brain’s functions. How does this technology work? The human brain has over 86 billion neurons. Neurons have three main parts: the dendrite, the soma and the axon. The dendrite receives signals, the somas are the processing units and axons send out the information. When the total input arriving in the soma exceeds a certain threshold, the axon generates a short electrical pulse. Neural interfaces work through a series of electrodes that gather data from these pulses. A chip on the scalp analyzes the data and can even communicate with other technologies using Bluetooth and artificial intelligence, software that allows machines to mimic human functions. AI is now able to detect the important signals and analyze them, then execute different motions accordingly.</p>

<p>With a BCI, people can control home appliances, activate car brakes and type and control cursors just by thinking. BCIs can also deliver targeted electromagnetic pulses to improve memory, attention and consciousness for cognitively impaired patients and alleviate symptoms for chronic pain, substance abuse and depression.</p>

<p>While this all may seem like something out of a science fiction novel, BCIs are arriving at the forefront of society sooner than you think. Once this technology is popularized, it may be accessible not just to patients with spinal cord injuries, but to everyone. According to VentureBeat, CTRL-labs CEO Thomas Reardon believes neural interfaces will be commercially available in the mid-2020s. Back in 2017, Dr. Krishna Shenoy, a professor of electrical engineering at Stanford, predicted that “the day will come — closer to five than 10 years from now… when a self-calibrating, fully implanted wireless [BCI] can be used without caregiver assistance, has no cosmetic impact and can be used around the clock.”</p>

<p>In just a few short years, it could be perfectly normal to drive without touching a steering wheel, receive the weather forecast in your head and direct your thermostat to warm up or cool down while you’re nowhere near it. BCIs still can’t read brain signals with perfect accuracy, but they are rapidly improving. The better they become, the more they will continue making the impossible, possible.</p>
