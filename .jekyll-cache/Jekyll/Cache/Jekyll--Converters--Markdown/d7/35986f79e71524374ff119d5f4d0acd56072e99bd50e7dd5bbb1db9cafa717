<center><i>Student social networks in U.S. high schools contain racial divides and variations in the number of friendships each individual has. In the model above, the color of the dot represents the race of each student: white dots for white students, gray dots for black students, light gray dots for Hispanic students and black dots for students of other races.

Humans are inherently social beings. According to Dom√®nec Mel√© and C√©sar Gonz√°lez Cant√≥n in their book ‚ÄúHuman Foundations of Management,‚Äù sociability is one of the core characteristics of humankind, as communication and collaboration initiate relationships between individuals. In InterSTEM‚Äôs third speaker lecture, Dr. Matthew Jackson ‚Äî an economics professor at Stanford University and an extensive researcher in game theory, microeconomics and social networks ‚Äî discussed the economic implications of our social networks.</p>
