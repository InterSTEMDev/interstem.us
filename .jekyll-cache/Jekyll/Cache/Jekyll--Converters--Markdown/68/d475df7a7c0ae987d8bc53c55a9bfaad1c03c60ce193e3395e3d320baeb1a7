<p>Studying for hours for little results, cramming at the last minute the night before a test, or forgetting everything you just studied. These methods are deemed inefficient for obvious reasons, but what exactly is efficient studying? What form of studying helps recall the most information in a timely manner?</p>

<p>First of all, notes. Notes are an effective studying method because they help us learn both in school and out of school. Taking notes in class ‚Äúforces you to pay attention and helps you focus in class‚Äù. It‚Äôs more efficient than solely listening to the teacher, regardless how much you focus. Notes constantly keep you active and learning. There are many different types of notes, each appealing to different people. The first is summarizing (typically in a notebook or on scratch paper). With this method, an individual would write down the key points they hear in a lecture and use it for studying purposes later on. This is efficient because it keeps the person engaged in the class, but excludes minor, ‚Äúless important‚Äù details, which may or may not contribute to the subject overall. Another method can be flashcards. Flashcards are typically helpful for learning definitions, so their use is more restricted/limited  than typical paper notes. They are still efficient, however, because one can study the material and quiz themselves  with ease. Last but not least, Cornell notes. Cornell Notes are infamous for being assigned  by teachers, and they serve their purpose incredibly well. This format is structured so that an individual   takes notes by using bullet points to highlight important information, as well as summarization at the end of the notes. Some honorable mentions, though more uncommon, can be The Outline Method, the Mind Mapping Method, and more. Notes are meant for studying in a productive manner, so it‚Äôs important that the user feels comfortable and the method is helpful for them.</p>
