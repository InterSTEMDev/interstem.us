Taking notes is one of the most important parts of the learning process. Students often spend a lot of time considering how to take notes, only to end up choosing a technique unfit for the material they’re tackling. So here we’ll be covering the pros and cons of each and discussing the right font-color combination for ideal note-taking.</p>

<p><b>Comparison</b></p>

<ol>
  <li>Accuracy
When it comes to accuracy, typing certainly wins out as it’s much faster to type than to write something down. However, this definitely depends on the material one is taking notes on. If it demands that notes be taken down verbatim then transcribing the lecturer’s speech, this would call for a laptop. But it’s very important to note that taking down notes in the form of a transcript isn’t effective for all subjects. A study was conducted by psychology scientists Pam Mueller and Daniel Oppenheimer in which students were asked to write down notes on a number of TED talks using the method that they normally used to take notes. The results showed that although the two types of note-takers did equally well on questions that required facts-citation, laptop note-takers performed particularly worse on the conceptual questions. That made the scientists suggest that students who took down handwritten notes were involved in more information processing than laptop users. As a result, they sorted through the information and opted for the more relevant ones to add to their notes. Additionally, the study suggests that writing by hand improves memory retention and understanding.</li>
</ol>

<p>The conclusion was that students who took more notes scored higher on the test, but that also applied to those who had less verbatim overlap. This proposes that unconscious transcription nullifies the advantage of having more content.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Legibility, organization and accessibility
Typing notes on a laptop offers a more aesthetic structure, easier editing and instant spelling check. So laptop users have the advantage of not having to worry about bad handwriting or making a mess of their notes when they make a mistake. While sharing handwritten notes could be a hassle, sharing digital notes is a piece of cake. Not to mention syncing them across devices makes them accessible anytime and anywhere.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Distractions
The ease and simplicity laptops offer come at a price. Although the extra tools and resources they provide save the note-taker the inconveniences that other note-takers face, that also means more distractions. For example, many people cannot resist checking social media while they’re in a lecture.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Studies also show that the laptop user is not the only one affected by those distractions. According to Harvard University, researchers at York and McMaster conducted an experiment in which they had students watch a lecture and then take a comprehension test. Some students were randomly asked to carry out a couple of short tasks on their laptops during the lecture, like looking up movie times. The rest of the students were allowed to focus on the lecture. All seats were randomly assigned.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, the multitasking students scored about 11% lower on the test than those who focused on the lecture. But interestingly, the students sitting near the multitaskers also got affected. Students who weren’t multitasking but could view the screen of a multitasker’s laptop scored 17% lower on comprehension than those who had no distracting view. So it’s important to note that by choosing typing as a method of note-taking, one could potentially distract those around them.</p>

<p><b>Factors to consider when deciding which method to use when taking notes:</b></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The type of learning that is called for
According to Effectiviology, note-taking through typing works better when the material requires factual learning, which involves memorizing specific details and merely entails a shallow understanding of the material. However, conceptual learning, which involves securing a rigorous understanding of the fundamental concepts in the material, calls for taking notes manually by hand.
On that account, the student must first determine the kind of material they’re dealing with and choose the note-taking method accordingly.</p>
