<center><i>Oxytocin is commonly referred to as the ‘love hormone’ because it is released when we engage in activities that stimulate attraction. This image presents the molecular structure of oxytocin. <a href="https://www.ambiopharm.com/articles/in-honor-of-valentines-day-we-introduce-the-celebritide-oxytocin-also-known-as-the-love-hormone/" target="_blank">(AmbioPharm)</a>

The sky is painted a dark blue with small specks of light barely visible within it. The soft drops of rain cascade onto you. They stand a foot from you, looking at you in such a way that it makes your heart race and palms sweat. Suddenly, all rationality is gone.</p>

<p>You can’t help but think, “Why do I have these butterflies in my stomach?”</p>

<p>Although literature and films provide an understanding of the concept of love that we all wonder about, it can also be described from a scientific point of view. The reason for the sleepless nights and endless conversations can be explained by multiple different hormones and neurochemicals that cause the joyous feeling known as love.</p>

<p>According to Harvard University, a study at Rutgers led by Helen Fisher indicates that there are three categories that define romantic love. These categories - lust, attraction and attachment - all contain their own set of hormones that act on us when we experience the giddy feeling.</p>
