As a child of the 21st century, Bitcoin is, and will no doubt continue to be at the forefront of the digital currency revolution. Versatile and secure, investable and ever-expanding, Satoshi Nakamotoâ€™s application of blockchain technology has blossomed into proportions that must have been unimaginable before its creation. Microsoft, Home Depot, Burger King, Starbucks: all of these major retailers have started the movement of accepting Bitcoin and other forms of cryptocurrency as a form of payment. Who knows? One day, Bitcoin may become the new dollar bill - as liquid as cash, and accepted anywhere and everywhere. Only time will tell how the wonders of Bitcoin and its siblings will transform the world.</p>
