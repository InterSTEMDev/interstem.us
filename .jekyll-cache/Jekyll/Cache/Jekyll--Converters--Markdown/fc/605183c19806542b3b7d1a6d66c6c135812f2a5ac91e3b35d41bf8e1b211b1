<center><i>Augmedics is one of the many companies that developed an AR platform to perform surgeries more efficiently. <a href="https://orthostreams.com/2018/11/today-3-startups-using-augmented-reality-in-surgery/" target="_blank">(OrthoStreams)</a></i></center>

The world of medicine has advanced significantly in recent years. With new technology and surgical procedures, we have uncovered a myriad of ways to treat illnesses and perform surgeries. However, with increased knowledge comes increased risk. Because new surgeries are more complex, surgeons require up to 10 times more training and experience before they can perform the surgery well, and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28742711/" target="_blank">the National Center for Biotechnology Information</a> shows that 30% of graduating general surgery residents are unable to perform these procedures independently. We are falling behind in the medical field as technology outstrips our ability to utilize it, a fact which is evident when medical errors are the third leading cause of death in the nation, according to <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2019/08/16/virtual-reality-improve-surgeon-training/" target="_blank">Stat News</a>.</p>

<p>This is where virtual reality comes in; the development has enabled surgeons to practice procedures in a safe and non-consequential environment. Simple, user-friendly VR headsets, like the <a href="https://www.oculus.com/?locale=en_US" target="_blank">Oculus Rift</a>, are the direction the field is heading in for practicing surgical procedures before performing them on a patient. While this type of technology is not implemented widely, as there is little data to back up its usage, a <a href="https://hbr.org/2019/10/research-how-virtual-reality-can-help-train-surgeons" target="_blank">study at UCLA</a> by the David Geffen School of Medicine showed that training with VR improved results by 230% in comparison to traditional training. Long-term research is necessary to prove VR’s usefulness, and although the medical community is notoriously slow to adopt new methods or techniques, efficiency and forward-thinking is crucial now more than ever as people depend on healthcare professionals to survive.</p>

<p>Augmented reality, AR, is different from virtual reality in that it places a “layer” of data or a screen in the real world (think of the mobile game Pokémon Go from a couple years back). There are various software and technology companies that have developed AR, including Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens" target="_blank">HoloLens</a>, Google’s <a href="https://www.google.com/glass/start/" target="_blank">Google Glass&lt;/a. and Facebook’s <a href="https://www.popsci.com/story/technology/facebook-augmented-reality-glasses-audio-superpowers/" target="_blank">AR Glasses</a> (still in development). During surgery, AR can connect medical professionals in different locations to provide additional expertise for a surgery, regardless of distance. Instead of receiving help via text, phone, or camera, surgeons can use AR to provide a direct live-streaming experience to the recipient for the most accurate data.</a></p>

<p>One medical technology company, <a href="" target="_blank">Medivis, has designed a program to alter the surgeon’s vision and overlay images directly onto the operation area, which can reduce human error and increase efficiency. Their learning-based software, AnatomyX, has 2000+ users in over 30 classrooms. XVision, which was developed by the company Augmedics, is a wireless headset that presents anatomical structures that give surgeons an x-ray visual of the operating field without requiring another screen.</a></p>

<p>By combining the benefits of VR and AR, we can revolutionize the way that people train for and perform surgeries, minimizing risk and increasing success. All that is needed are open minds and curious learners, which the up-and-coming graduate classes can supply. It’s an exciting time for the field of medicine, as we are recognizing the value of bringing technology and engineering to human-performed operations.</p>
