<b>Introduction</b></p>

<p>Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an anxiety disorder that develops after a traumatic experience. A certain trigger after the incident may cause a person to recall the horrifying event, which in turn may cause them to become distant with those they once were close to. Everything from a mugging, threats, scarring incidents, robbery, and natural catastrophes can be a traumatic experience. Depression and drug misuse also exacerbate the condition. Different individuals encounter novel experiences that are more traumatic than others. This makes it difficult to precisely determine what particular event is traumatic.</p>

<p>During the period from just after the traumatic incident to six months later, acute stress disorder occurs. PTSD begins at the six-month mark and persists thereafter. However, not all trauma patients develop PTSD immediately following exposure. Some individuals respond rapidly to traumatic exposure, while others remain unscathed only to experience the sudden onset of PTSD symptoms months or years later. Flashbacks, extreme anxiety and uncontrollable thoughts about the incident can all be symptoms.</p>

<p><b>PTSD Amongst Veterans</b></p>

<p>We have seen a dramatic rise in the <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25077185/" target="_blank">number of Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans</a> seeking help for PTSD over the past few years, shining a spotlight on this chronic condition and posing crucial questions about adequate treatment services and care barriers. At any given point, the disorder affects millions: about 8% of individuals in the United States will experience it at some point in their lives. Military veterans are extremely vulnerable: 20% of those who served in Iraq and Afghanistan returned home with PTSD or depression. And since the year 2000, over 350,000 service members have been diagnosed with traumatic brain injury, many of whom have cognitive or behavioral disabilities. The alarming suicide rate among veterans is a testament to psychic wounds that linger long after the war ends: 20 end their lives every day.

<b>Impacts of Mental Trauma on Memory and the Brain</b></p>

<p>Abuse of children and other causes of severe stress may have permanent effects on the areas of the brain involved in memory and emotion. In particular, the hippocampus appears to be very stress-sensitive. Not only will stress damage to the hippocampus cause difficulty in coping with memories and other consequences of prior traumatic events, but it can also hinder new learning. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK3874/" target="_blank">Research</a> has shown that as part of its regular function, the hippocampus can regenerate nerve cells, but stress impairs the process by preventing or slowing down the regeneration of neurons.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/253494116_The_Invisible_Epidemic_Post-Traumatic_Stress_Disorder_Memory_and_the_Brain" target="_blank">A study</a> was carried out to see whether the symptoms of PTSD matched the observable loss of neurons in the hippocampus. Vietnam war veterans with declaratory memory issues caused by PTSD were first tested. These war veterans were found to have an 8% decrease in right hippocampal volume, assessed with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and brain imaging. However, there were no changes in other areas of the brain.

<p><br /></p>

<p>The study found that reduced right hippocampal volume was associated with short-term memory loss in patients with PTSD. When looking at PTSD patients who were victims of physical or sexual assault during their childhood, similar findings were observed. According to more recent studies that have reported hippocampal volume reduction in PTSD, these studies also indicate that the reduction in hippocampal volume is unique to PTSD and is not correlated with conditions such as anxiety or panic disorders.</p>

<p>Damage to the hippocampus, following exposure to the strain brought on by childhood abuse, results in distortion and fragmentation of memories. In linking and arranging various aspects of memory, the hippocampus plays an important role and is assumed to be responsible for locating the memory of an occurrence in its proper time, place and context.</p>

<p>For example, if a person was a victim of childhood abuse due to alcohol and was locked away in a closet of old clothes, he or she may only remember the smell of alcohol or that of the old clothes, but not the part about having been locked in the closet. He or she may experience a sudden flashback or have a panic attack when the smell of alcohol hits them. Psychotherapy (talk therapy) or an experience that causes similar feelings will help the patient rebuild memories in these situations.</p>

<p>Another significant area is the amygdala, a region of the brain involved in associative learning, value encoding and emotional responses. PTSD symptom intensity can be independently predicted by both smaller amygdala volume and less reliable monitoring of the negative value of face stimuli (negative surprises in the environment) in the amygdala.</p>

<p><a href="" target="_blank">A study</a> conducted by Daniela Schiller, Ph.D. and Ilan Harpaz-Rotem, Ph.D. on combat veterans offered the conclusion that the severity of PTSD symptoms is mirrored in how combat veterans react to negative external shocks when the anticipated results are not as planned, and how the way the brain is tuned to these stimuli is different.

<p><br /></p>

<p>Variations between those with or without PTSD were also shown in other brain regions involved that are related to danger learning, such as the striatum (a part that coordinates multiple aspects of cognition) and the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (a brain region that subserves cognition and motor control).</p>

<p><b>Treatments</b></p>

<p>To minimize symptoms and improve function, having appropriate care after the development of PTSD symptoms may be crucial. The ideal PTSD treatment, which is secure, safe, fast-acting and has minimal side effects, has been elusive. And, as with many mental health conditions, patients often have difficulty embracing or adhering to any of the available solutions. For years, the military department and healthcare experts have sought a range of options for effective treatment.</p>

<p>One of the recent procedures is the stellate ganglion block (SGB) procedure, which was discovered to be effective in the fall of 2019. The operation involves injecting the stellate ganglion with a local anesthetic. This community of neck nerve cells helps control the “fight or flight” function of the body. Some military medical facilities started offering this treatment to PTSD patients in the early 2010s.</p>

<p>As the SGB procedure was studied by more researchers and patients, the results appeared positive. But the proof of its efficacy was still required by the medical community. RTI International, a nonprofit research institution, launched a randomized, controlled SGB trial in 2014, and gave an official report by the end of 2019. A suggested reason for the sustained efficacy of SGB on PTSD, as well as the effects of hot flashes and complex regional pain syndrome, is that local anesthetic application to the stellate ganglion contributes to a decrease in the growth factor of the nerve and subsequently, a decrease in the amount of sympathetic nerve sprouting and norepinephrine.</p>

Psychotherapy and drugs that are short- and long-term will also treat PTSD well. Sometimes, the two types of treatment are more successful together.</p>

<p>Another way of treating PTSD is by using Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT). It is a particular method of cognitive-behavioral therapy that has been effective in minimizing PTSD symptoms. Over 12 hours, CPT is administered; the process helps patients learn how to question and change harmful trauma-related assumptions. In doing so, the patient develops a new perception and conceptualization of the traumatic incident so that its ongoing detrimental effects on current life are minimized.</p>

<p>Exposure to a traumatic stimulus is another method of intervention widely used to help people confront fears in cognitive-behavioral therapy. Prolonged exposure (PE) is a special form of cognitive-behavioral therapy that helps people gradually handle memories, emotions and circumstances relevant to their trauma. Most individuals try to stop something that reminds them of the trauma they have endured, but their anxiety is intensified by doing so. An individual may minimize PTSD symptoms by consciously learning that the memories and signs related to trauma are not dangerous and do not need to be prevented by confronting what has been avoided.</p>

<p>Concerning physical treatment, paroxetine and sertraline are the only drugs to have been approved by the FDA for treating PTSD. Since different people react to drugs differently, and not everyone’s PTSD is the same, the doctor can also prescribe other “off label” medicines, meaning that the manufacturers of those medicines have not requested the FDA to review drug trials proving the drug is specifically effective for PTSD. These may include antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), antipsychotics or second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs), beta-blockers or benzodiazepines. Medications do not remove the symptoms, but they may make them more manageable by decreasing their severity.</p>

<p>The National PTSD Center provides self-help resources, including the PTSD Coach Online app and the PTSD Coach app. These provide therapy to deal with depression, anxiety and other symptoms that can be formed by people who have been through trauma. When PTSD patients feel depressed, the apps can help them relax, boost their mood, teach them how to solve tough issues and help change their thought patterns.</p>

<p><b>Taking Action</b></p>

<p>An individual who is subjected to a traumatic event may feel powerless, causing a concerned partner to take action to assist them. Perhaps the most effective approach is being there for the person, showing acceptance and concern, and listening without being judgmental or providing advice. It is necessary to promote healthy living, such as adherence to the diet, exercise and refraining from smoking and excessive alcohol use. Arranging fun recreational activities is another way to help those with PTSD live a happier and more relaxed life.</p>
