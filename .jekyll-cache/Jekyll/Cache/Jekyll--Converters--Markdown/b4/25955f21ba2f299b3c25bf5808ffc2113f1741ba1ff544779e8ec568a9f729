Covering 70% of the Earth’s surface and containing 50 to 80% of life as we know it, the ocean is our most valuable resource, but it is in danger. Although the <a href="https://www.sciencehistory.org/the-history-and-future-of-plastics" target="_blank">Science History Institute</a> reports observations of plastic pollution as early as the 1960s, the threat of irreversible damage due to pollution has become increasingly obvious in the past decade.</p>

<p>Every year, over eight million tons of plastics enter the ocean and wreak havoc on marine life. According to the <a href="https://www.noaa.gov/education/resource-collections/ocean-coasts/ocean-pollution" target="_blank">National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</a> (NOAA), plastics of all sizes can be deadly. Large, floating tangles of netting and trash can trap sea creatures or provide transportation for invasive species across the ocean. Smaller pieces can wrap around animals or be confused for food. Over time, plastics may seem to break down, but in reality, they only break apart into tiny pieces. These microplastics absorb harmful chemicals and are often mistaken for plankton by predators and make their way up the food chain.</p>

<p>Eventually, the ocean plastics accumulate in one of the world’s five massive rotating current systems called gyres. Once they’ve reached the gyres, the plastics form patches of concentrated debris. The most famous is the Great Pacific Garbage Patch which covers nearly 1.6 million square kilometers, or three times the size of France.</p>

<p>So, how can we remove these mini-continent-sized garbage patches? This question is being asked by scientists everywhere and is especially important to young people, who believe if a solution is not found soon, the damages will haunt them for the rest of their lives and generations to come.</p>

<p>One of the most notable young people in ocean conservation is 26-year-old Boyan Slat from the Netherlands. His non-profit, <a href="https://theoceancleanup.com/about/" target="_blank">The Ocean Cleanup</a>, aims to remove 50% of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch over the course of five years and nearly all ocean plastics by 2050, much sooner than previously predicted.</p>

<p>Slat’s plan is unique in that it cleans the ocean directly by removing trash from the garbage patches rather than focusing on prevention or coastal cleanups. In a 2012 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROW9F-c0kIQ&amp;list=WL&amp;index=3" target="_blank">TED Talk</a>, Slat, just 18 years old at the time, explained his plan.</p>

<p>He attributed his inspiration for his plan to a scuba diving trip in Greece two years earlier when he noticed more plastic in the water than fish. Later, as a school project, he and a friend pulled fine, mesh netting through ocean water and spun the nets’ contents in a centrifuge to separate plankton from microplastics. In doing this, Slat found a simple, efficient way to safely remove tiny pieces of plastic from the ocean without harming the smallest of marine life.</p>

<p>Slat’s new discoveries turned his attention to the ocean’s five polluted gyres; with the help of professors from the University of Delft, Utrecht and Hawaii, he estimated there would be 7.25 million tons of plastics in the surface layers of the gyres alone by 2020.</p>

<p>Previous removal plans required boats with nets to capture floating trash and were far too expensive to be practical. Slat proposed a design with several strategically placed, floating platforms, anchored to the seafloor, with nets suspended between them. The design would use the gyres’ own currents to push the plastic into the nets, removing an estimated 55 shipping containers of trash a day.</p>

<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQQffhWdihs&amp;list=WL&amp;index=4" target="_blank">NowThis News</a>, Slat shared how he executed his plan. In 2013, he left the University of Delft, to start The Ocean Cleanup. With only 300 euros and no sponsors, his plan seemed impossible, but with the help of crowdfunding, Slat was able to launch the largest scale plastic cleanup ever attempted.</p>

<p>The first challenge Slat and his team faced was the complex design of the anchor lines needed to attach the platforms to the seafloor, five kilometers below. The proposed systems were complicated and required too many lines to be cost effective. The team was ready to quit when two interns suggested a drifting design. The new plan was drastically different and involved several smaller systems scattered throughout the patch that would use wind and waves to move towards larger concentrations of plastics.</p>

<p>The Ocean Cleanup released their first system (001) into the Pacific in September of 2018, and after extensive durability testing, released System 001/B in June of 2019. Slat hopes to have System 002 ready by 2021 and would like to refine the design further before launching a total of 60 systems to tackle the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.</p>

<p>The organization has since started a new line of sunglasses made from the collected plastics and sells them on their website to fund the continuation of the cleanup.</p>

<p>Slat and his team’s newest project focuses on removing plastics before they can reach the ocean in the first place. Appropriately named the Interceptor, this system intercepts trash in rivers before they enter the ocean. The Ocean Cleanup has identified a total of 1,000 rivers responsible for 80% of ocean plastics. The system is positioned on the side of the river that the current pushes towards, collecting floating debris while still allowing boats to pass.</p>

<p>Slat’s discoveries and inventions have opened a world of possibilities to save the ocean from permanent plastic pollution. What started as an idea of a 16-year-old high school student has grown into a global project. Slat continues to push the boundaries of ocean cleaning technology while inspiring young scientists everywhere.</p>
