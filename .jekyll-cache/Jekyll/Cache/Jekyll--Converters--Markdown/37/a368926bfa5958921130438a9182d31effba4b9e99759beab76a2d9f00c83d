Over the course of millions of years, homo sapiens have evolved into the dominant organism across the globe because humans are the only animals capable of working flexibly and creatively in large groups, according to bestselling author and doctoral graduate from the University of Oxford Yuval Harari.</p>

<p>Even though we have developed such advanced cognitive function and physical abilities, scientists like Dr. Alywyn Scally of the University of Cambridge assert humans are still evolving. Scientists from Stanford University revealed, using data from 3,000 genomes collected across the United Kingdom, that height, head circumference in infants and hip size in females (factors relevant to birth) have undergone selection in the past 2,000 years. In another study by Stanford University, researchers found that traits like lactose intolerance and blond hair and blue eyes have spread rapidly in the past 2,000 years. An investigation by evolutionary geneticists Joseph Pickrell and others claims that the ApoE4 allele, which is connected to Alzheimerâ€™s disease, has dropped in frequency over time as carriers die earlier on in life.</p>
