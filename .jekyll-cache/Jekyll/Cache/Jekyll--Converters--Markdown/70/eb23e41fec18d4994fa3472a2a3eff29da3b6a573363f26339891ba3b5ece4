The global pandemic has closed schools and other locations across the country, forcing the music industry, along with others, to use technology to preserve their way of life. For one group in particular, musicians, this transition has been especially difficult. While business meetings can carry on in a more or less normal format through Zoom and other communication technologies, musicians require being able to hear one another in real-time, as they use their ears to fit in with the musical ensemble. If it seems hard to not interrupt people when simply talking on Zoom, imagine trying to achieve precisely timed entrances that are hard to coordinate even without the added complications of slow internet. This issue has made many people ask the question, ‚ÄúHow can we have the technology to send humans into space and communicate with them but not the technology to produce one of man‚Äôs most basic forms of expression, music?‚Äù</p>

<p>Well, it turns out we do have that ability; we simply need to look a little deeper. One of these technologies actually allows musicians to play virtually with almost no delay. Although other iterations exist, one of the main areas this function exists is in Jamulus, an application that runs on a computer and allows musicians to hear each other by compiling the sounds into a server. While it is helpful to set up a private server that can host a specific group, especially if a group meets regularly, it is not necessary. Many servers are public, allowing anyone from around the world to join them and are therefore a great meeting place for a group, provided that you click the solo option to ensure that no one breaks up a rehearsal. Another application of Jamulus occurs when a group has rehearsed enough that they can put on a concert live online from their own houses. This also requires the use of Zoom (to display video), open broadcast software, YouTube live and someone to manage all of this. Of course, there are limitations to this, which means that most people using Jamulus will need to use an ethernet cable to minimize the overall delay and ping time so that this automation is actually useful. There is also the possibility of a technological failure, such as a server crash or downed internet, but overall the benefits of this server certainly outweigh the negative aspects, especially while people are not comfortable or safely able to congregate and play.</p>

<p>The other option is to not play live at all, but rather record each part individually and place them all together to form a piece. This requires a click track, which the musician can line themselves up with, as well as background music and a clear start time in each video so that it is clear when the piece starts. Unfortunately, it is not this simple because as any musician will tell you when playing in a group, it isn‚Äôt just about one person playing correctly, but it‚Äôs about the musician fitting into the correct sound of a group. As such, audio engineering will say that lining up the audio portions of each person will make the Los Angeles Philharmonic sound like a sixth-grade orchestra. However, by using technologies such as GarageBand, Audacity or other audio editors, audio engineers can do anything from splitting tapes and shifting the time between each note to changing the pitch of that note altogether. The result is a soundtrack that reflects or even enhances the abilities of the live ensemble. This choice was often the preferred method of large ensembles or school groups, as technologies such as Jamulus lag with too many people online. Additionally, schools may not be able to provide everyone with the appropriate amount of technology to run Jamulus.</p>

<p>Even with these technologies, it is hard to replicate the sound of a live performance through an old built-in computer or phone microphone. These microphones were made to pick up vocal sounds and often distort the sounds of instruments, especially loud brass sounds. This created a whole new market for external microphones which were once rare. There are two main types of microphones: dynamic, and condenser, each with its pros and cons. Dynamic microphones are more capable of withstanding loud sounds, while condenser microphones are better at picking up the intricacies of soft sounds but cannot deal with loud sounds well. These microphones have definitely become more popular over the past year, but many musicians, especially inexperienced ones, have decided that their computer or phone microphone better suit their needs.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the exact sound of a live performance can‚Äôt be replicated online, which is why concerts are still a popular phenomenon even though any song can be accessed for free on online platforms such as YouTube. Still, with the addition of softwares such as Jamulus, audio editing softwares, and microphones, musical performances have been able to continue throughout the pandemic.</p>
