Launched in 2009 from the anonymous Satoshi Nakamoto’s whitepaper, Bitcoin (BTC) was created to be an electronic payment system “based on cryptographic proof instead of trust.” Bitcoin is now the world’s largest cryptocurrency (digital currency) with an astonishing value of over $55,000 for a single coin and is also the first application of blockchain technology, an innovative creation that allows it to be distributed, traded and stored. A blockchain is essentially a collection of “blocks,” files that record all of the transactions that occur, making them transparent and visible to all of the computers that run Bitcoin’s code and store its blockchain. The creation of Bitcoin has united thousands of people around the world over a common goal: obtaining bitcoin and turning a profit.</p>
