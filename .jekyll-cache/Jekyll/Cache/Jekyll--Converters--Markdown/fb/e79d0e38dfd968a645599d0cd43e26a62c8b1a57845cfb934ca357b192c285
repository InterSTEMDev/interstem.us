“Mixing” vaccines may boost our immunity against COVID-19. <a href="https://www.clinicaltrialsarena.com/analysis/covid-19-vaccine-mixing-the-good-the-bad-and-the-uncertain/" target="_blank">(Clinical Trials Arena)</a>

The COVID-19 pandemic has lasted for over a year now, and many different brands of vaccines have been created in response to the coronavirus, such as the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Oxford-AstraZeneca and Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccines. Even though not federally approved yet, the idea of mixing and matching these vaccines is gaining popularity as there is significant evidence that doing so strengthens the immune system. This “mix and match” method of administering vaccines can also be referred to as heterologous vaccination, which means that an individual receives one type of vaccine for their first shot and then another type for their second shot.</p>

<p>To better understand how this mixing approach utilizes different “types” of shots to strengthen the immune system, a brief overview of the human immune system is necessary. The human immune system has two main lines of defense: antibodies and T cells. Antibodies are proteins made by the immune system that bind to virus particles and “deactivate” them before they can infect any cells. T cells get rid of cells that have already been infected.</p>
