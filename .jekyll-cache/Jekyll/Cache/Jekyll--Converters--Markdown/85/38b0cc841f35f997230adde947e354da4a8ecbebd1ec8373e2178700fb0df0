As opposed to popular belief, music isn’t only used for entertainment, as it has numerous applications in arts and sciences. However, as it turns out, it can take a toll on our physical and psychological well-being.</p>

<p>At first glance, it may seem surprising, but many people overlook the impact music has had on their lives; instead, they only perceive music as a way of biding their time. A good mixtape is especially important during these times, where everyone is bound to an inactive, home-restricted lifestyle. Starting with its impact on general productivity and mental health to its impact on cardiovascular immunity and neurogenesis, one could argue that music is one of the most effective yet underrated “medicinal drugs” of our time. British neurologist Robert Sacks said it best: “The power of music to integrate and cure is quite fundamental. It is the most profound non-chemical medication.”</p>

<p>Be it Bruno Mars, Ariana Grande or Juice Wrld, any musical piece you listen to can and will affect your body and mind. Listening to music allows stimulation of <a href="https://psychcentral.com/news/2018/12/23/music-soothes-anxiety-reduces-pain#1" target="_blank">specific sensory brain pathways</a> that decentralize the cognitive focus from other sensory paths responsible for making us feel pain. It creates a positive emotional response and helps reduce pain stimuli by shifting our center of attention from pain to music. So if you are suffering, listen to some tune you enjoy, and it will help you manage the pain. You may find yourself turning to music once again to diminish your levels of stress. <a href="https://myscena.org/newswire/the-science-behind-why-classical-music-is-good-for-mental-health/#:~:text=Neurologist%20Dr.%20Michael%20Schneck%20found%20that%20classical%20musichelps,26%25%2C%20laughter%20by%2016%25%20and%20relaxation%20by%2011%25." target="_blank">Natural sounds, flat musical notes and classical western music</a> reduce cortisol, a hormone responsible for stress and anxiety, in the body.
Now, whether you are doing homework, studying for a test or working on a project, you will often try to eliminate any distractions, including music, to avoid severe procrastination. However, music does influence the mindset with which we will tackle a task. Yes, you heard it right: listening to your favorite bopping Lady Gaga song will not only motivate you to complete an assignment but also make you more <a href="https://psychologenie.com/effects-of-music-on-mind-brain#:~:text=%20Effects%20of%20Music%20on%20the%20Mental%20State,of%20learning%20and%20thinking.%20Listening%20to...%20More%20" target="_blank">productive and confident</a>! It will heighten your performance and put a stop to procrastination, which will have a positive effect on your mental health and self-esteem.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, music has shown to be quite a factor in fighting certain mental and brain illnesses. When exposed to gentle music, the human brain produces lots of serotonin (a neurotransmitter) the lack of which causes depression. Consequently, relaxing and soothing notes are the weapon of choice in a fight against depression. Moreover, patients that are victims of Alzheimer’s disease and dementia will benefit from musical performances. Their brain cells, the ones that play a role in their memory capacity, will be activated, which would allow the patients to fight the obliviousness brought by their disease. Similarly, <a href="https://neuro.hms.harvard.edu/centers-and-initiatives/harvard-mahoney-neuroscience-institute/about-hmni/archive-brain-1" target="_blank">researchers at Harvard</a> noticed that when people with Parkinson’s disease heard rhythmic music, the brain canals responsible for physical movement dynamized, partially relieving their condition.</p>

<p>Additionally, music has a remarkable curative effect on the human body. Listening to music can increase the chances of a positive post-surgery outcome. When listening to our favorite melody, our bodies produce endorphins, which speed up the curative process of healing. A study shows that working out without a beat will make reaching our full physical potential harder and increases the quantity of oxygen we use. On the other hand, a workout with music in the background allows us to maximize our effectiveness with less oxygen consumption. Listening to music has been shown to reduce fatigue, allowing a longer physical activity, even in patients with cancer. According to the following study, music can even make our brains create more neurons, which leads to cerebral plasticity, an element that affects child and adult development. Listening to music is recommended to people with various diseases, such as the previously mentioned cancer or high blood pressure. Patients with heart conditions had their blood pressure lowered and their heart rate slowed down simply from listening to music for 30 minutes. According to epidemiology professor at West Virginia University School of Public Health Kin Innes, “music seems to selectively activate neurochemical systems and brain structures associated with positive mood, emotion regulation, attention and memory in ways that promote beneficial changes.”</p>

<p>Music has come a long way, with its styles changing throughout history frequently. The one thing to remain unfazed about it is that any interaction music ever had with the human ear has resulted in a physical or psychological impact on the human body. It is crucial to remember the effects of music on our healthiness, especially now that everyone is at home, barely going outside, mostly working during the day and watching television or YouTube in the evening. Listening to music while working, during a workout or before going to sleep instead of binge-watching a series would have more beneficial effects on our health. Of course, we won’t stay perfectly fit and healthy just by listening to music now and then, but it would be one of the steps that lead us towards a better, more durable way of living.</p>
