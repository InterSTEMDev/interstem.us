The mass production of fast fashion, as shown here, can negatively affect the environment with its extreme use of natureâ€™s resources. <a href="https://thinksustainabilityblog.com/2020/04/14/the-unsustainable-growth-of-fast-fashion/" target="_blank">(Think Sustainability)</a>

<p>Our planet is already carrying a heavy burden ever since we started industrializing. Power plants burn fossil fuels, which have greatly contributed to the increase in greenhouse gas emissions along with mass deforestation to clear the way for buildings. Another great example would be the clothing industry, which has also played a role in destructing the environment by producing fast fashion clothing. Fast fashion is a practice used by some clothing retailers in an attempt to capitalize off the latest trends in fashion. They make a profit by mass-producing trendy outfits for a low price, but these clothes are made of low-quality materials such as polyester.</p>
