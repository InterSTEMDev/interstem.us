COVID-19 has changed all of our lives to some degree. For many of us, it plucked us from our day-to-day schedules and plunged us into quarantine, where we became prisoners to our own homes. We became stuck in the house, all day every day. With each passing moment, we found fewer and fewer things that would keep us entertained. Many of us began to feel miserable, lonely and heartbroken over losing connection with the outside world. Isolation left us no choice but to look inside at all the things about ourselves and our surroundings that we werenâ€™t quite as attuned to before. And a big one of these re-examinations is our relationship with our pets.</p>

<p>Before all of the coronavirus regulations, many people left for their nine to five jobs without really stopping to think about what their pets experienced for the entire day at home. If you think about it, stay-at-home pets are pretty much always in a state of quarantine. They donâ€™t leave the house unless itâ€™s to go on walks, only interact with the people who live with them and spend most of their time in isolation. During quarantine, pet owners finally get a taste of what their pets have to go through on a normal basis. Except, for the pets themselves, their lives are now turned upside down by their owners.</p>

<p>Humans being around 24/7 is a sudden disruption to the petsâ€™ daily routines. The day no longer belongs entirely to the pet anymore; now, life revolves around the ownerâ€™s schedule. Feeding times might change based on the ownerâ€™s desires; walks may become more frequent since people have so much free time and playtime might increase as will training time for tricks and commands. Due to this, many pets may lose their sense of security and predictability in the dayâ€™s events. With their ownersâ€™ desires spinning at them from every possible way, pets will feel like their control is disappearing from their actions. Alone time will start to dwindle, especially in a house where younger children are romping around all the time.</p>

<p>All of this will make pets start to feel stressed out, which will manifest in changes in behavior. Just as humans have their coping mechanisms for stress such as playing with hair, pacing around, or chewing on fingernails, animals will show signs of anxiety too. These tics are known as displacement behaviors, and some common forms that exist in dogs and cats are overgrooming, mounting, pacing, vocalizing, scratching or spinning. Birds might begin vocalizing or speaking more, engaging in defensive postures, or responding frantically to human contact.</p>
