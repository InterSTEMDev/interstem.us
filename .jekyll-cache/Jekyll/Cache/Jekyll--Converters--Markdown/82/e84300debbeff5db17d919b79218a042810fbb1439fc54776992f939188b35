For decades, antibiotics have been considered the wonder drug that cures all infections. It all started when Alexander Fleming, a Scottish microbiologist, came back from a two-week vacation in 1928 only to accidentally discover green mold (now known as Penicillium) developing on his culture plates and killing some bacteria heâ€™d been growing. Since then, the discovery of Penicillin (a substance produced by Penicillium) has changed the course of medicine and enabled physicians to treat formerly brutal and life-threatening diseases. The overuse of antibiotics, however, propelled the evolution of resistance. As a result, plenty of bacteria have become unresponsive to antibiotics, and consequently, a number of infections have become incredibly challenging to treat.</p>

<p><b>What are antibiotics?</b></p>

<p>Antibiotics are drugs specifically targeted to damage the essential parts of a bacterial cell or disrupt its critical functions. They are usually prescribed to prevent or treat bacterial infections like strep throat and pneumonia. Although the body can occasionally fight off infections on its own, in instances where a bacterial infection is already severe enough to cause a high-grade fever, antibiotics become the primary choice of treatment.</p>

<p>But what happens when bacteria become resistant to a certain antibiotic? Well, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a patient would expect longer-lasting illnesses, extended hospital stays, additional follow-up doctor visits and more costly treatments. Such alternative treatments usually display more adverse side-effects and occasionally even fail to treat the infection, resulting in death.</p>

<p><b>How do bacteria become resistant to antibiotics?</b></p>

<p>There are two major pathways: DNA mutations and horizontal gene transfer.</p>

<p>When DNA mutations result in a favorable change in the organism, this leads to its evolution, a natural process that occurs in all living beings. One example is a bacterium that has recently acquired a certain trait that allows it to resist an antibioticâ€™s assault. This â€˜upgradedâ€™ bacterium would grow and divide just like its siblings, but up until now, itâ€™s very unlikely that it would overrule them in number, considering itâ€™s pretty new. When the antibiotic is introduced, however, all the â€˜traditionalâ€™ bacteria targeted by this antibiotic die, whereas the â€˜upgradedâ€™ bacteria are left unscathed with a greater chance of survival.</p>

<p>Although mutations are a natural way for bacteria to acquire antibiotic resistance, certain factors can still increase its prevalence. Those include excessive use of antibiotics, their inappropriate handling (like taking antibiotics to treat viral and fungal infections) and a discontinued course of antibiotic treatment. Recently, the overuse of antibiotics in agriculture has started to gain attention too, especially in food-producing animals. In many countries, the major reasons for antibiotic use in animals are growth promotion and disease prevention rather than the treatment of sick animals.</p>

<p>Another pathway for bacteria to obtain resistance is horizontal gene transfer. Simply stated, it involves a resistant bacterium gifting its resistance to a susceptible bacterium through plasmids. A plasmid is a small naturally-occurring DNA molecule distinct from a bacterial cellâ€™s chromosomal DNA. The genes carried in plasmids often provide bacteria with genetic enhancements, such as antibiotic resistance. By undergoing a process called conjugation, bacterial cells can share plasmids, and thus their advantageous add-ons, with each other to increase their chances of survival.</p>
