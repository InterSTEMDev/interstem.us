<p><b>Intergalactic Repulsion</b>
First, letâ€™s take a look at how we know that the universe is expanding. In 1925, American astronomer Edwin Hubble saw that galaxies that were farther away from Earth emitted light with spectral lines that had shifted towards the red end of the electromagnetic spectrum.</p>

<p>This phenomenon is now known as redshift, where light waves experience the Doppler effect. Light takes longer to reach the Earth when the object emitting the light is moving away from the Earth. Since the light takes a longer time to reach a certain point, the waves appear longer because they are stretched out. If these galaxies appeared to be redshifted from Earth, that meant that they were moving away from Earth.</p>

<p>In 1929, Hubble was able to study the rate at which galaxies travel by observing a direct proportionality between a galaxyâ€™s distance and the velocity at which it travels away from us (as shown in the image down below). This is summarized in Hubbleâ€™s Law, v=Hd, where â€˜vâ€™ is velocity, â€˜Hâ€™ is the Hubble constant and â€˜dâ€™ is the distance of a galaxy. This law is used to calculate the velocity of any galaxy given its distance, or vice versa.</p>

<b>An Expanding Universe</b>
A similar pattern to the repulse between galaxies is shown in atoms or molecules filling a vacuum. The law that governs this principle is known as entropy and it causes particles to fill in a space until the system is homogeneous.</p>

<p>It can then be deduced that galaxies are moving away from each other to fill some sort of empty space. The fact that galaxies are moving away from one another must mean there is a background force acting as some repulsive form of gravity that causes space itself to expand.</p>

<p>The term â€˜dark energyâ€™ was conceived in 1998, as a way to refer to this phenomenon. In 1915, Albert Einstein published his paper on his general theory of relativity, and with it, his field equations. His equations were supposed to find a link between the geometry of spacetime and the mass density of the universe.</p>
