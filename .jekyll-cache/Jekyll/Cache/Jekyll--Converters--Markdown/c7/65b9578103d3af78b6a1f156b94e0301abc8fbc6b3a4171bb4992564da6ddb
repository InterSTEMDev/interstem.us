<center><i>Southern California is just one of the regions currently plagued by bad air quality thanks to wildfires.

Fires burning all across the western United States have caused millions of Americans to wake up to smoky air. Many of these people, especially those living in wildfire-prone California, have experienced poor air quality like this before. In recent years, poor air quality due to wildfire smoke has prompted school closures, event cancellations and even strict shelter-in-place orders. However, this year, an unprecedented number of wildfires combined with an unprecedented pandemic complicates matters even further.</p>

<p>Wildfire smoke can harm a person‚Äôs respiratory and cardiovascular systems, both of which are also targeted by COVID-19. According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), wildfire smoke is ‚Äúa complex mixture of gases and fine particles‚Äù. The fine particles are the cause for worry; when they come in contact with the lungs, they inhibit the lungs‚Äô ability to function properly. As a result, the cardiovascular and respiratory systems are both threatened, and the lungs are also more susceptible to infection. According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), if COVID-19 comes in contact with weakened lungs, those lungs are more likely to be infected. The CDC also warns that if a person is already infected, the weakening of the respiratory and cardiovascular systems could allow the virus to permanently damage the heart or lungs. This creates a situation where the combination of wildfire smoke and COVID-19 has disastrous consequences.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that the masks required for protection against COVID-19 are not effective against wildfire smoke. The CDC recommends wearing an N95 mask but also mentions that at this time, healthcare workers desperately need N95 masks. In the likely event that one cannot acquire an N95 mask, the best thing to do would be to stay inside as much as possible. In fact, staying inside at home protects against both the COVID-19 infection and unhealthy air quality!</p>
