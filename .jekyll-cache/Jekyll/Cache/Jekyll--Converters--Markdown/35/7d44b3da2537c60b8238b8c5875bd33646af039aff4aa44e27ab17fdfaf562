Many people are shy when it comes to social situations. They might feel hesitant to meet new people and feel overwhelmed by social gatherings such as parties. These feelings are completely normal, but they can reach a point of severity where they are not. Some people feel terrified of the mere idea of meeting new people, and they might completely avoid social gatherings as a result. These people likely have what is known as social anxiety disorder (SAD), which they can either be born with or develop over time.</p>
