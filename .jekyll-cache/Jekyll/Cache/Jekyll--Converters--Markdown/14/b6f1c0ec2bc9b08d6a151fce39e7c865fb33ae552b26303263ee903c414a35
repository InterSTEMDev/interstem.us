Infinity. A value without limit. This concept created the law of continuity and allowed people to understand black holes, land rovers to mars, create new mathematical theorems and study the moon. Each discovery mentioned above comes from a different field in STEM. This is because there are three different types of infinities - the mathematical, the physical and the metaphysical. It is because of this that answering this question becomes more complicated. In this article, we’ll take an in-depth look into the mathematical infinities and see whether they exist or not.</p>

<p>During the late 19th century, the question of mathematical infinity arose in mathematician Georg Cantor’s mind, and he began investigating this idea. Through his extensive research, he discovered that there are many kinds of infinities in math, some larger than others. If all infinities were to be separated into groups, they would be countable infinities and uncountable infinities. He started by writing a sequence of numbers; let’s say, for example, that the even numbers are in one-to-one correspondence with another sequence within the real number system. By doing this, he found that the countable infinities are actually smaller than the uncountable infinities (also known as the continuum). This finding led to the continuum theory, which mathematicians are unable to disprove or solve even now. You may be asking how there could be infinities smaller than other infinities? So, to understand this, let’s take some whole numbers and even numbers in one-to-one correspondence; in other words, we are pairing up one whole number with an even. It should look something like this.</p>
