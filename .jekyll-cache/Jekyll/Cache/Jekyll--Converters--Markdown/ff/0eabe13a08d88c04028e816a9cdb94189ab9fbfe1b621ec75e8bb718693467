<p>Epilepsy. Everyone has heard of it, but few have a complete understanding of what this neurological disorder entails. November is Epilepsy Awareness Month, so letâ€™s examine and dispel some of the most common myths about the brain disorder that shows itself mainly through seizures.</p>

<p>Myth #1: Very few people have epilepsy.
The Truth: The Center for Disease Control (CDC) notes that there are 3.4 million people in the United States currently living with an epilepsy diagnosis. This is about 1.2% of the population of the United States and is equivalent to the population of Uruguay. According to the Epilepsy Foundation, more than 65 million people worldwide lived with epilepsy as of 2014, and that number continues to grow as hundreds of thousands of people are diagnosed each year.</p>

<p>Myth #2: There is only one type of epilepsy.
The Truth: The Epilepsy Foundation currently recognizes 26 different types of epilepsy. Some types are more severe than others, and many types of epilepsy that appear in children are temporary. The International League Against Epilepsy reclassifies types of epilepsy almost every year, so the number of recognized epilepsy types changes often.</p>
