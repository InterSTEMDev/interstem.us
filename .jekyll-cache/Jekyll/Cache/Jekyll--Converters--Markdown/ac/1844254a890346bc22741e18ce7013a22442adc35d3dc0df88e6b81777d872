<center><i>As COVID-19 shows no signs of slowing, a consequent surge of misinformation and pseudoscience emerges, and its effectiveness is frightening. <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/slideshow/photos-wildfires-rage-northern-california-n1237462" target="_blank">(Healix)</a></i></center>

COVID-19 has been labeled as many things: a hoax, a virus not any more harmful than the flu, and a result of 5G wireless technology. The surge of misinformation accompanying the pandemic is preventing people worldwide from addressing COVID-19 as it truly is. COVID-19 is a global emergency that should be treated as such.</p>

<p>The spread of pseudoscience, or beliefs falsely regarded as being based on science, is largely evident in our current pandemic. Many people choose to blindly follow these theories, labeling themselves as insignificant in the spread of the disease. Arguably the most important issue is ensuring that every citizen knows their individual impact on the spread of the virus.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-superspreading-events-drive-most-covid-19-spread1/" target="_blank">Scientific American</a>, new research indicates that “between 10 and 20 percent of infected people are responsible for 80 percent of the coronavirus’s spread”. These people are known as <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/06/15/1003576/whats-a-coronavirus-superspreader/" target="_blank">superspreaders</a>, and a large percent of these people are unaware that they are carrying COVID-19 since they do not experience any symptoms of the virus. Without proper precautions, these people can spread it to others around them, and are defined as being “unusually contagious”. This can create an explosion of cases from an individual who was unaware they had the virus.</p>

<p>Therefore, limiting exposure to other people as well as wearing a mask in public can save thousands of lives. Unfortunately, a great number of people simply refuse to accept the science behind the virus and can be great contributors to its spread. These people ignore the well-informed professionals that have spent their lives studying viruses like COVID-19. Some may take fatal measures to avoid care or take dangerous measures to cure themselves because they are scientifically illiterate. Although many people possess the common sense to avoid clearly dangerous acts such as injecting themselves with bleach, they can follow harmful misinformation that can have a great impact on the health of themselves and others. Therefore, the importance of being a well-informed citizen cannot be understated.</p>

<p>The scale of the crisis calls for immediate action regarding the spread of misinformation. First, trusted individuals and institutions need to stop legitimizing false COVID-19 theories. When leaders such as the President of the United States claim masks are insignificant in preventing the spread of COVID-19, as many as 10% of Americans (30 million people) will refuse to wear masks. Thus, America remains the world’s leader of cases. Similarly, in Brazil, <a href="http://www.bioethics.net/2020/06/the-covid-19-pandemic-and-the-problem-of-pseudoscience/" target="_blank">President Jair Bolsonaro dismissed the epidemic</a> and the legitimacy of the virus. Consequently, Brazil remains a major center for COVID-19 cases.</p>

<p>The fight against pseudoscience is hopeless if people are unsure who to trust and put their faith in the wrong people. Pseudoscience is unfortunately very effective and gives people a false sense of their place in this pandemic. If people trust well-informed professionals with their care, the world would be better off. Therefore, scientists and medical professionals should be the face of the fight against misinformation. This would hopefully show the general masses that trusting scientists is the best option for their health.</p>

<p>Although the theories themselves are ridiculous, they need to be taken seriously, especially since they are spreading while the world fights a global pandemic. When people believe in pseudoscience, they ignore real medical professionals’ recommendations for their health, such as wearing masks in public. These effects are dangerous to society, and therefore, the general public needs to become more scientifically literate, and politicians and health professionals need to come together against the spread of misinformation.</p>
