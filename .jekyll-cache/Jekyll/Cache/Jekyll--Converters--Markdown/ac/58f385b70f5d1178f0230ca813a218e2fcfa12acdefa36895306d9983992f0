Uncovering the low demand for monoclonal antibody treatments for COVID-19
With the vaccination process beginning a few weeks ago, the approval and use of monoclonal antibodies for treating COVID-19 is still new to many. Many people were not fully aware of the development of these drugs until President Donald Trump received an experimental antibody cocktail earlier in October.</p>

<p>An antibody is a protein that is used by the immune system to recognize and neutralize antigens, any substances the body identifies as foreign. And monoclonal antibodies are created in labs by cloning a white blood cell.</p>

<p>On Nov. 9, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for monoclonal antibody therapy using a drug called bamlanivimab. The FDA issued another EUA for Regeneron‚Äôs monoclonal antibody cocktail (REGN-COV2) combining casirivimab and imdevimab on Nov. 21. Both treatments were intended for patients with moderate symptoms and who are at high risk for COVID-19; therefore, patients who were already hospitalized or required oxygen treatment could not receive this therapy. There were additional requirements as well. For example, patients had to be of at least 12 years of age and weigh at least 40 kilograms. Patients at a higher risk for COVID-19, such as those with chronic medical conditions, were also eligible.</p>

<p>The FDA stated that after clinical trials, both treatments were shown to ‚Äúreduce COVID-19-related hospitalization or emergency room visits in patients at high risk for disease progression within 28 days after treatment when compared to placebo.‚Äù</p>

<p>According to CNBC, the United States purchased 300,000 doses of bamlanivimab in October. They later purchased another 650,000 doses. And according to BioSpace, the United States plans on providing 300,000 doses of REGN-COV2 to patients at no cost by January 2021. Due to Trump‚Äôs appraisal regarding his treatment, many health officials were concerned about the potential of a high demand for these drugs.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, administering these drugs has been a challenge in many hospitals nationwide, despite the number of drugs available.</p>

<p>The Wall Street Journal explains that only 20% of the doses are being administered. There is a prominent divide regarding the use of these treatments. Some disease specialists such as the National Institute of Health do not recommend the antibody treatments because of the insufficient amount of data from trials. In contrast, officials from Operation Warp Speed encourage health professionals to use the doses. In fact, chief scientific adviser of the operation Moncef Slauoi said that he found the use of monoclonal antibodies ‚Äúdisappointing,‚Äù as his data revealed that only 5 to 20% of the doses had been used.</p>

<p>Additionally, the treatments should be given within 10 days after the patients‚Äô first symptoms. Health officials must isolate the patients and observe them for about an hour after the infusion, so the lack of staff or space in a hospital can be another contributing factor to the lack of treatment administered.</p>

<p>‚ÄúAntibody therapies always work best the earliest they‚Äôre given,‚Äù immunologist at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health Arturo Casadevall said to Business Insider. ‚ÄúThis has been known for 130 years.‚Äù</p>
