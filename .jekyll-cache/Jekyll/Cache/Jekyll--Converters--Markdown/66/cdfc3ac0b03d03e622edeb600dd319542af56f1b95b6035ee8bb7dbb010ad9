On Oct. 6th, 2020, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced the recipients of the Nobel Prize in Physics. The English physicist Roger Penrose received half the prize “for the discovery that black hole formation is a robust prediction of the general theory of relativity.” The other half of the prize was divided between German astrophysicist Reinhard Genzel and American astronomer Andrea Ghez “for the discovery of a supermassive compact object at the centre of our galaxy.” Their work provides a deeper understanding of the least understood phenomena in the universe.</p>

<p><b>Roger Penrose</b>
<br />In 1915, Albert Einstein presented his theory of general relativity. He explained that gravity wasn’t an invisible force but an effect of the fabric of spacetime. And depending on the mass of an object, that object warps the fabric of spacetime to a different degree. The effect is similar to if four people held up the corners of a blanket and placed an object, like a basketball, onto the blanket. The basketball rolls to the middle and significantly warps the blanket, whereas an object like a golf ball would barely make an indent.</p>

<p>Black holes form when enough matter is compacted into a small amount of space and creates an area of space with a gravitational pull strong enough to prevent light from escaping. Most black holes form when massive stars die and collapse into themselves. Interestingly enough, Einstein didn’t believe that black holes existed because he thought the idea seemed too outlandish. But in 1965, ten years after Einstein’s death, Penrose claimed that black holes were a natural consequence of Einstein’s theory of relativity. Plus, he had the evidence to prove it. In a paper titled “Gravitational Collapse and Space-Time Singularities,” he proved “a star of sufficient mass [would] always collapse into a black hole.”</p>

<p>Using mathematical proofs and new methods that he invented, Penrose demonstrated how the collapse into a black hole was inevitable within our understanding of Einstein’s theory of general relativity. One example of his revolutionary ideas was his introduction to the complicated idea of conformal transformations. The idea of conformal transformations leads to Penrose diagrams that depict the circumstances under which a star collapses into a black hole. Penrose not only described in fine detail what happens during the formation of a black hole but also how all the known laws of nature cease within black holes.</p>

<p>Reinhard Genzel and Andrea Ghez
For over twenty years, Dr. Genzel and Dr. Ghez have led teams observing the behavior of stars surrounding the radio source at the center of the Milky Way known as Sagittarius A*. They concluded that the only possible explanation for the narrow orbit paths of the stars in the vicinity of Sagittarius A* was the existence of a supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy.
Two separate observational teams led by Genzel and Ghez have observed stars orbiting the center of the milky way since the early 1990s. By mapping the paths of these stars, both teams found that the stars surrounding Sagittarius A* moved at astonishing speeds. These stars moved at a speed of 12,000km per second, a number which doesn’t even compare to theEarth’s speed of 460km per second. Although Sagittarius A* is unobservable directly, the current theory of gravity shows that the only explanation for these heavy stars orbiting at such fast speeds is a supermassive black hole.</p>
