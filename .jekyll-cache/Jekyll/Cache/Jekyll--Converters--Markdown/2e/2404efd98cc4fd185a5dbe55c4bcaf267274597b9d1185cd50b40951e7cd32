<center><i>Oxytocin is commonly referred to as the ‚Äòlove hormone‚Äô because it is released when we engage in activities that stimulate attraction. This image presents the molecular structure of oxytocin. <a href="https://www.ambiopharm.com/articles/in-honor-of-valentines-day-we-introduce-the-celebritide-oxytocin-also-known-as-the-love-hormone/" target="_blank">(AmbioPharm)</a>

The sky is painted a dark blue with small specks of light barely visible within it. The soft drops of rain cascade onto you. They stand a foot from you, looking at you in such a way that it makes your heart race and palms sweat. Suddenly, all rationality is gone.</p>

<p>You can‚Äôt help but think, ‚ÄúWhy do I have these butterflies in my stomach?‚Äù</p>

<p>Although literature and films provide an understanding of the concept of love that we all wonder about, it can also be described from a scientific point of view. The reason for the sleepless nights and endless conversations can be explained by multiple different hormones and neurochemicals that cause the joyous feeling known as love.</p>

<p>According to Harvard University, a study at Rutgers led by Helen Fisher indicates that there are three categories that define romantic love. These categories - lust, attraction and attachment - all contain their own set of hormones that act on us when we experience the giddy feeling.</p>

<p><b>Lust</b>
<br />Lust is defined as an intense desire for something and is the basis for all organisms‚Äô need to reproduce. There are two main hormones that are produced by the hypothalamus of the brain: testosterone and estrogen. These are also referred to as the ‚Äòmale‚Äô and ‚Äòfemale‚Äô hormones, though they are prominent in both genders. The stimulation and production of these hormones are what drive procreation within humans.</p>

<p><b>Attraction</b>
<br />The attraction stage is more commonly associated with the feeling of butterflies and fear of rejection. Romantic passion is the more distinct phase we come across that we question or deny once we have fallen head over heels. The Atomic Scale Design Network (ASDN) states during the first attraction, we deal with the neurochemicals that oversee our neural activity: norepinephrine, dopamine and phenylethylamine.</p>
