<a href="https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/exoplanet-catalog/5471/kepler-452-b/" target="_blank">Kepler-452b</a> is a planet that exists light-years away from us. The planet can and most likely once did support life. But what exactly does this planet have to offer? Are there any downsides that may disrupt the possibility of the planet supporting life?</p>
