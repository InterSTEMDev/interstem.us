<p>Science and religion seem to always be at odds. In the 1500s, when Nicolaus Copernicus announced that his observations about other planets supported the idea that Earth is a round planet revolving around the sun, the Catholic Church strongly objected to his findings because they contradicted the words of the Bible. Even today, some people doubt the roundness of Earth, pointing to the Bible as evidence against the proven idea. Throughout history, scientists and religious leaders have clashed as both point to different types of evidence to support their ideas about the world. History repeats itself today. Many religious people do not believe in human-caused climate change, while most scientists do. The conflict between science and religion has created deep fissures in society. Is it possible for the two subjects to peacefully coexist?</p>

<p>The most common point of contention between scientists and theologists is likely evolution. When naturalist and biologist Charles Darwin introduced the theory of evolution in the nineteenth century, religious leaders everywhere panicked. Darwin‚Äôs theory of evolution, which states that all living things evolved from a common ancestor, seemed to disprove many religious texts. As many religions preach that humans were created by a god as unique and superior beings, the idea that humans, animals, bacteria and every other living thing come from the same ancestor does not sit well with many religious people. However, Harvard professor Martin A. Nowak believes that evolution poses ‚Äúas little problem for religion as [the concept of] gravity.‚Äù Nowak notes the evolution of what he calls ‚Äúhuman cooperation‚Äù is evidence for the theological belief of human superiority.</p>
