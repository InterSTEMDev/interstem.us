Water. Where the start and end of alien life occurs. You may think that water is highly limited, maybe even to just our own Earth, but actually, we’ve discovered tons of it. Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe, and oxygen is the third most abundant (the second most is helium, which is highly unreactive). Thus, when these elements come into close contact with each other, they form water. According to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation#:~:text=The%20Drake%20equation%20is%20a,in%20the%20Milky%20Way%20galaxy." target="_blank">Drake Equation</a>, the numerical range for the number of aliens in the universe can range from one to tens of millions. With such a large range, we would expect to have made some contact with a higher intelligence being, but we haven’t. This is exactly what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enrico_Fermi" target="_blank">Enrico Fermi</a> was thinking when he came up with Fermi’s Paradox, which states the contradiction between the lack of alien encounters and the high chance of their existence. This led Fermi to ask one question (and maybe the one you’re thinking right now): where is everybody?</p>

<p>There are multiple ways to approach this. According to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdqcVjCe0bc" target="_blank">Aperture</a>, one of those ways was proposed by Robin Hanson. He figured that we’ve been asking the wrong question: instead of expecting that the universe should be filled with human life forms, he thought that we should accept that life is extremely rare and our time might be limited. If he is right, we have miscalculated the steps necessary to create life, either in difficulty or correctness. Through this re-consideration of our objectives for life, we created the Great Filter.</p>

<p>The Great Filter could be anything in the timeline that created humans. It could be whatever started abiogenesis (the origin of life), the first proper replication of DNA with enough mutations that it caused evolution, the first creation of organized eukaryotic cells or even the creation of a moon to cause a proper atmosphere. It could be anything. Well, we passed it. We made it past the Great Filter. Give yourself a pat on the back…but, what if it’s ahead of us?</p>

<p>What if there was life teeming in the universe that was killed by a filter that exceeds our current position in time? Maybe we will witness the Great Filter when the Andromeda Galaxy smashes into our own, and we get pushed into the darkness of space. The concept behind the Great Filter is that maybe life had grown in a different place in the universe, but was never able to grow to an intergalactic scale because of some major event that wiped it out. Some relatively recent events that humanity has endured that had the potential to be the Great Filter are coronal mass ejections, a geomagnetic storm from the sun, a large meteor and a global pandemic. Just some of the ways humanity could meet its end.</p>

<p>However, the idea of the Great Filter is extremely flawed, according to <a href="https://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/greatfilter.html" target="_blank">Robin Hanson</a>. We are extrapolating this entire theory from a single data point: Earth. This is the only data point for life that we’ve ever known. What if other life forms don’t have a colonialist mindset and don’t want to find other planets with life? What if, instead of water, aliens live off of liquid mercury? The extrapolation of every variable is extremely hard to take into account when it’s all just based on speculation.</p>

<p>Maybe there isn’t any Great Filter and the lack of life elsewhere just shows that our existence is a coincidence, and we are simply lucky. We are lucky to understand our reality. We are lucky that the universe is so fine-tuned for our existence - from our location in the solar system to the abundance of water. Maybe we are the only ones in our universe and we’re lucky to be here.</p>

Explaining the world around us with science has always seemed interesting to him from metamorphosis to the Higgs Boson. He hopes to help bring more youth to STEM fields so they can understand the natural world around us and appreciate the world for its uniqueness.
