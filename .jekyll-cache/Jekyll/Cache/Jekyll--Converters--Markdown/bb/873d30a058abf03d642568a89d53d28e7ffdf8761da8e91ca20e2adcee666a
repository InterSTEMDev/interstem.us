You probably took a chemistry course at some point in your life — maybe it was a six-week introductory unit in eighth grade science, or maybe it was a year-long high school class. It is entirely possible that you have not thought about chemistry since you took that course many years ago, but chemistry applies to your life every day in the simplest way — through cooking. When you cook a meal, you witness chemistry in action.</p>

<p>A recipe starts with ingredients that all have nutritional benefits. But after you cook these raw ingredients, how do these nutritional benefits change? Does a cooked carrot have the same health benefits as a raw carrot? To understand how cooking affects nutrition levels in food, let’s look at the beginning of a recipe for vegetable hand-pies and walk through a couple of examples of nutritional changes.</p>

<p>This recipe calls for four different vegetables (clockwise from upper-left) — carrots, potatoes, rutabagas (potato-like root vegetable), and onions.
