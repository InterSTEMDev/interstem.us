It‚Äôs a clear spring night, and you decide to go stargazing with some friends. You gather some pillows, blankets and board games, laying them on the lawn grass. Laying down on the cushions, you see some faint stars in the distance, nothing too unusual. Hoping to perhaps see a shooting star, your eyes rapidly jerk up in response to what looks like a link of stars traveling through the night sky. Not 10 or 20, rather 100 or 200 rapidly beaming circles rushing in and out of your view. You turn to your friends, who look anything but worried about what you perceive as a potential alien invasion, instead calmly admiring the crazy view. ‚ÄúStarlink, huh?‚Äù one exclaims.</p>

<p>What is Starlink? Well, it is no alien invasion, rather a movement of satellites that stream around Earth at all times. Get lucky, and you may even see them making their way around your home. Though simply aesthetically pleasing to some, these futuristic-looking sky sequins serve an important purpose: giving everyone on Earth access to faster Internet speeds and data. But, of course, they also obstruct an astronomer‚Äôs view, which is more controversial than you may think! In the latest Starlink launch on Jan. 20, SpaceX reached the large 1,000 satellite mark, totaling 1,015 beams of light fluttering across the sky. Though this may already seem like an impressively large number, SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk, is nowhere near finished, as he wants to include at least another 41,000 satellites to the bunch.</p>

<p>With the capabilities of wireless satellites, Musk desires to cut out the lag often associated with typical telecommunications products, providing a profit for not only those companies if successful, but also for SpaceX. The satellites will be at different proximities to Earth, as this allows the greatest range and network efficiency for individuals around the globe. The first satellite was launched in May 2019, and the first set had a successful altitude launch of 340 miles from the ground. Starlink serves to create faster proximities of Internet speed, and it will work up to a gigabit per second with a latency of 25 to 35 milliseconds, with 5 trillion bytes a day of data generated as of June 2020. For comparison, the speeds that Starlink will eventually offer stand 10 times faster than typical 4G networks, but not as fast as 5G. Starlink has a goal to serve individuals who may struggle to find good connections due to their geographic location, a number Musk estimates to be between 3% to 4% of the world population.</p>

<p>You may be curious as to what operating system SpaceX uses to control Starlink. Currently, the network system known as Linux is being put into full force, with each satellite containing around 4,000 Linux computers. Linux is no stranger in the world of networking and communication; it has been an open-source operating system in use since 1991. Linux has had a rivalry with Windows operating systems, such as Windows 10, with Linux claiming it runs ‚Äúfaster and smoother‚Äù than its counterpart.</p>

<p>SpaceX‚Äôs project is one of innovation; however, they are not the only company with an equally ambitious project. Companies like Vodafone, Samsung and even Amazon‚Äôs Blue Origin rocket launching company are currently striving to create similar satellite networks, attempting to provide the internet to more people than ever before.</p>

<p>Though these competitors may bring out full-force systems similar to Starlink in the future, for now, we can all credit that nightly-chain of rapidly expanding ‚Äòstars‚Äô to none other than SpaceX.</p>
