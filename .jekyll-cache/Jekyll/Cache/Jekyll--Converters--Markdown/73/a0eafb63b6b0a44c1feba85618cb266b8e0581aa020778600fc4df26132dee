In the United States, assessments at school often trigger stress, anxiety and fear within students. Parents and teachers have also been against testing because it forces teachers to focus specifically on material that will be on exams rather than helping students improve upon critical thinking. Despite the opposition, recent studies have proven that taking tests, a form of retrieval, helps students remember what they have learned with more success compared to other techniques often favored by educators.</p>
