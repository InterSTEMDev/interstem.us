Avoiding pain and seeking pleasure are the two most basic principles humans pursue. But if we think about it, occasionally, people seek pleasure in order to evade pain. Itâ€™s fascinating to acknowledge that human nature amounts to something as simple as this. But what if someone canâ€™t feel the pain to begin with? Imagine never having to experience the immense pain that comes along with breaking a bone. It could be described as every personâ€™s dream come true, but itâ€™s actually a curse in disguise.</p>
