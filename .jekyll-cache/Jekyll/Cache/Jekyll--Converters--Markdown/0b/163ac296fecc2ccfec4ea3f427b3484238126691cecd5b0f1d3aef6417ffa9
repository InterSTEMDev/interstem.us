We usually associate crying with those who are vulnerable or those who are too helpless to help themselves. Babies and small children, who are notorious for bursting straight into tears whenever they are presented with any sort of upsetting situation, usually come to mind. But this is understandable‚Äîthey cry to communicate since their limited capacity of language falls short. However, even when you‚Äôve grown well past that age and you‚Äôre expected to solve your problems with words and actions instead of sitting and weeping about them, you might still find yourself sitting and weeping every now and then. The question today is why shedding tears is our bodies‚Äô natural response to various events in our lives. What exactly makes human beings cry?</p>

<p>According to Jonathan Rottenberg, an emotion researcher and psychology professor at the University of South Florida, ‚Äúcrying signals to yourself and other people that there‚Äôs some important problem that is at least temporarily beyond your ability to cope.‚Äù Interestingly enough, there are many different tear-inducing problems you can face, and they will give rise to varying kinds of tears.</p>
