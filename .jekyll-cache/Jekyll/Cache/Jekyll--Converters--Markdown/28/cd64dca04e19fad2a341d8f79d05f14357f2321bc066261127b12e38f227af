Uncovering the low demand for monoclonal antibody treatments for COVID-19
With the vaccination process beginning a few weeks ago, the approval and use of monoclonal antibodies for treating COVID-19 is still new to many. Many people were not fully aware of the development of these drugs until President Donald Trump received an experimental antibody cocktail earlier in October.</p>

<p>An antibody is a protein that is used by the immune system to recognize and neutralize antigens, any substances the body identifies as foreign. And monoclonal antibodies are created in labs by cloning a white blood cell.</p>

<p>On Nov. 9, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for monoclonal antibody therapy using a drug called bamlanivimab. The FDA issued another EUA for Regeneron‚Äôs monoclonal antibody cocktail (REGN-COV2) combining casirivimab and imdevimab on Nov. 21. Both treatments were intended for patients with moderate symptoms and who are at high risk for COVID-19; therefore, patients who were already hospitalized or required oxygen treatment could not receive this therapy. There were additional requirements as well. For example, patients had to be of at least 12 years of age and weigh at least 40 kilograms. Patients at a higher risk for COVID-19, such as those with chronic medical conditions, were also eligible.</p>

<p>The FDA stated that after clinical trials, both treatments were shown to ‚Äúreduce COVID-19-related hospitalization or emergency room visits in patients at high risk for disease progression within 28 days after treatment when compared to placebo.‚Äù</p>
