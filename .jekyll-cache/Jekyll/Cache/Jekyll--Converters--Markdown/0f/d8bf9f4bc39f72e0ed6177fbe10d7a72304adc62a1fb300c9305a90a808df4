Avoiding pain and seeking pleasure are the two most basic principles humans pursue. But if we think about it, occasionally, people seek pleasure in order to evade pain. It’s fascinating to acknowledge that human nature amounts to something as simple as this. But what if someone can’t feel the pain to begin with? Imagine never having to experience the immense pain that comes along with breaking a bone. It could be described as every person’s dream come true, but it’s actually a curse in disguise.</p>

<p><b>Importance of Pain</b></p>

<p>The sensation of pain protects humans from the damaging effects of dangerous stimuli and is therefore critical for the well-being of the organism. It’s important to point out, however, that pain shouldn’t be merely regarded as a form of perception, but rather a motivation to act.</p>

<p>According to Ingo Kurth, a doctor at the Institute of Human Genetics in Aachen, Germany, “We fear pain, but in developmental terms from being a child to being a young adult, pain is incredibly important to the process of learning how to modulate your physical activity without doing damage to your bodies, and in determining how much risk you take.”
According to psychologists, pain consists of three dimensions or components that work as a unit in order to deliver perceptual information that eventually affects the motor processes characterizing pain.</p>

<p>The first dimension is the sensory-discriminative, which allows the individual to assess the intensity, location, duration and nature of the pain. A disruption to this dimension would lead to insensitivity to pain.</p>

<p>Then comes the effective-motivational component. This component provides psychological responses like irritation, anxiety and fear that motivate people to get their bodies out of danger. A malfunction in this dimension would result in indifference to pain.
The final dimension is the cognitive-evaluative, which is the brain’s evaluation of the input in terms of past experiences and its appraisal regarding the probability of different response strategies.</p>

Tissue damage caused by a hot object, as an example, is detected by pain receptors (nociceptors) in the skin, each of which forms on one end of a neuron. When the nociceptor is activated, it sends an electrical signal to the spinal cord through the nerve fiber.</p>

<p>Within an area of the spinal cord called the dorsal horn, the electrical signals are transmitted to the brain from one neuron to another through synapses by releasing neurotransmitters, which are essentially chemical messengers.</p>

<p>In the brain, the signals reach the thalamus, which then conveys them to different parts of the brain. Signals are sent to the somatosensory cortex (responsible for physical sensation), the frontal cortex (in charge of thinking) and the limbic system (related to emotions).</p>

<p>At this point, a person would feel the sensation and respond emotionally to the pain by feeling irritated, for example.</p>

<p>However, by this time, the individual would have most likely already reacted involuntarily through a reflex response that occurs within the spinal cord. They would have shifted their hand away from the heat source mere milliseconds before the brain actually became aware of the pain sensation.</p>

<p>What is Congenital insensitivity to pain (CIP)?</p>

<p>Congenital insensitivity to pain is an umbrella term used to describe hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies (HSANs), which are rare autosomal recessive disorders characterized by the absence of pain sensation.</p>

<p>They are caused by mutations in the SCN9A gene, responsible for encoding a voltage-gated sodium channel that plays a significant role in nociceptive signaling. Both gain and loss of function mutations have been reported. For example, mutations that amplify this gene’s function causes autosomal dominant disorders characterized by extreme pain, whereas mutations that diminish the SCN9A gene’s function cause congenital insensitivity to pain.</p>

<p>Although CIP has a long history, it was not until recently that reports of individuals who showed CIP actually attracted medical attention. Scientists realized that probing into this rare disorder may offer a new understanding of pain itself, which in turn could help them better treat patients subjected to chronic pain conditions.
Patients with CIP do not seem to notice sensations of pain; that is, they have a noticeably compromised ability to perceive the intensity and quality of painful stimuli. They can sense the difference between sharp and dull sensations but cannot discern temperatures, and thus won’t notice - for example - something as typical as a hot beverage burning their tongue.</p>

<p>Young children with congenital insensitivity to pain typically have various wounds resulting from self-mutilation, like biting their lips and fingers, in addition to multiple burn-related injuries. The accumulation of these injuries usually results in a reduced life span in individuals with this condition.</p>

<p>It is believed that the reason this condition is so rare is because of the fact that very few patients dealing with congenital insensitivity to pain actually reach adulthood.
Congenital insensitivity to pain is closely associated with congenital indifference to pain, in which painful stimuli are perceived but there is an absence of the effective response to pain, rather than a lack of signal transmission. While these individuals report experiencing sensations of pain, they display no inclination to evade the painful stimuli.</p>

<p>With the absence of the body’s natural warning mechanism, many individuals with congenital insensitivity to pain display - albeit unintentionally - self-destructive behaviors as children. To put it simply, pain is indispensable for survival. By sensing it, a person is able to tell when and where their body needs further care and attention.</p>
