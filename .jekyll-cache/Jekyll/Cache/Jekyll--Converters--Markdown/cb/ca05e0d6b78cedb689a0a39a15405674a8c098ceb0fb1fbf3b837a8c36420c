If you‚Äôre like me, you belong to 90 percent of the world‚Äôs population of right-handed people. This is often genetically determined, though it isn‚Äôt clear why our evolution has led to more righties than lefties. It‚Äôs a well-accepted belief that lefties and righties are right and left-brained respectively. However, in keeping with new research, the concept of individuals being either left or right-brained might not be as fixed as once thought.</p>

<p>It is a widely acknowledged fact that most animals have an anatomically and functionally asymmetric brain. A number of the differences are learned and others are inherited. While the dominant side of the brain may be randomly assigned, a large spectrum of possibilities indicates that there could be something more than randomness at work.</p>

<p>Studies conducted on zebrafish embryos about their developing brain suggest that there can be a fight for dominance between the hemispheres. Researchers have known that neurons migrate long distances in an exceedingly developing brain. This is often controlled by a gene called fibroblast protein 8 (FGF8), which creates a protein that acts as a magnet to draw in nerve cells to one hemisphere of the brain.</p>

<p>There is little difference within the number of cells on each side, but what does differ are the types of neurons on the left and right and their connections. Each side of the brain contains FGF8, resulting in a tug-of-war to draw in certain migrating nerve cells. But this can be an unfair fight. Only on the left side of the brain is another protein, called Nodal, present.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe pair wins when it teams up with FGF8, causing a repetitive pattern of neuron links within the cerebral hemisphere that helps to clarify why in groups of people there is clear handedness,‚Äù Professor Stephen Wilson of University College London and Ph.D. student Jenny Regan explained to Live Science.</p>
