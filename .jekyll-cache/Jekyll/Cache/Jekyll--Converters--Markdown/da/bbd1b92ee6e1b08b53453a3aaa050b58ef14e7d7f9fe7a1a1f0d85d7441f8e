<p><b>What is time dilation?</b>
Einstein’s theory of relativity suggested a new outlook of space-time itself. He described time as modified; rather than time being a constant moving parameter, it moves relative to an object’s path. Time can be warped or changed by high gravitational forces and immense speeds. Essentially, speed and force can alter the fabric of space-time entirely. Timewarp predominantly causes time to slow down or speed up in the observer’s perspective, which is otherwise known as time dilation.</p>
