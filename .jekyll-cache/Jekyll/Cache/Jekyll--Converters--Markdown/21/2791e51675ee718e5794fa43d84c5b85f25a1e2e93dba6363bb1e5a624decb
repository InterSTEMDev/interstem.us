<center><i>This illustration ties into the origins of the word â€˜personality.â€™ The person alternating between two different masks is exactly what the actors did a long time ago to warrant the original Latin inspiration for the word. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=dcsc_EsJmsA" target="_blank">(Practical Psychology)</a>

A personâ€™s personality has a tremendous impact on their life. It affects their interests, aspirations, likes, dislikes and various other aspects of their being. Because of its large influence, it has an entire branch of psychology dedicated to learning more about it. This branch, known as personality psychology, aims to understand a personâ€™s psychological tendencies and how they are displayed in everyday life. This field has been growing ever since it was established back in Ancient Greece, and many discoveries relating to personality have been made due to its expansion.</p>

<p>For a brief history, the word â€˜personalityâ€™ comes from the Latin word â€˜persona.â€™ A persona was defined as a mask worn by actors when they were up on stage; those masks needed to be changed multiple times throughout a performance, as shown in the illustration above. This might be taken as someone changing how they present themselves to the world, which can also extend to the way people shift their personalities around certain people. Eventually, the word â€˜personaâ€™ gave way into â€˜personality.â€™</p>
