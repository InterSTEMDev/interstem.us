Biologically speaking, all animals have the blessing of procreation, the ability to bring a completely new individual into this world as a product of sexual intercourse between two partners of the opposite gender. However, some creatures can bypass the requirement of mating to create new life. Their bodies allow them to replicate themselves in such a way that the offspring contains the same biological information as the parent.</p>

<p>In some cases, the naturally occurring genetic modification will even produce fertile offspring. Nevertheless, some of the more highly intriguing processes hide behind a curtain of mystery from the public eye or have sunk into oblivion with the rest of the information learned in years of schooling. To shine some light onto some more precise concepts of parthenogenesis (also called incomplete asexual reproduction as sex cells are still involved), we will describe the four steps of the procedure, as well as some examples of the utility and marvels of this miraculous birthing.</p>

<p>Parthenogenesis consists of 2 main distinct phases: apomixis and automixis. Apomixis is the process of mitotic production of egg cells. In apomictic parthenogenesis, the oocyte, or female sexual cell, creates a copy of itself by mitosis, forming a pair of diploid cells. These diploid cells have all of the chromosomes needed for embryonary development. The derived offspring are exact copies of the parent cell. Some organisms that breed in this manner are aphids and flowering plants.</p>

<p>In automixis, egg cells are produced by meiosis. Usually, in egg cell development, the resulting daughter cells are split unevenly during meiosis. Asymmetrical cytokinesis eventually results in one large egg cell (oocyte) and several smaller cells called polar bodies. The polar bodies degrade without fertilization. The oocyte is haploid (has only a single set of unpaired chromosomes) and becomes diploid (has two pairs of completed chromosomes) after it is fertilized by male sperm. Because automictic parthenogenesis does not require male involvement, the oocyte becomes diploid by combining with one of the polar bodies or by duplicating its chromosomes. Since the following offspring is a product of meiosis, the occurring genetic recombination makes these individuals false clones of the parent cell.</p>
