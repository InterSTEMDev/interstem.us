With InterSTEM being based in Southern California, many of the volunteers, including myself, suffer from not-so-serious snow deprivation. Reminiscing the idea of frozen crystals falling from the sky, I took it into my own hands to create an alternate winter wonderland, one that anyone, regardless of their geographical location, can experience and enjoy.</p>
