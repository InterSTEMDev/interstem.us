Ad Astra Academy is a non-profit organization that visits underserved communities in various countries around the globe and works with students to foster an interest in science.  Launched in January 2015 in Northeastern England, their philosophy is based on utilizing humansâ€™ innate creativity and curiosity to develop STEM skills and a desire to pursue a career in science. The Academyâ€™s workshops can be anywhere from three hours to three months, and they provide participating schools with books, technology and resources to continue the program.</p>

<p>To test the efficacy of this program, a study was conducted in 2015 and in 2018 in a disadvantaged area of Rio de Janeiro, according to an article about the program from SciWorthy.</p>

<p>The three traits the researchers from the academy tested were competency, independence and relatedness. Competency was measured by the studentsâ€™ ability to recall the steps of the scientific method and facts about Mars exploration, while independence and relatedness were measured using the studentsâ€™ perceptions of their new skills and confidence in their scientific abilities. Overall, both metrics showed growth, and students finished the program with a new passion for science and a desire to learn more in the STEM field.</p>

<p>So far, the organization has worked with the aforementioned groups in Rio de Janeiro as well as Bangladesh to capture twelve new images of the surface of Mars. The teams partnered with the HiRISE camera, an instrument on the spacecraft currently looking down at Mars, and with Dr. Paul Hayne, the chief scientist at Ad Astra, to interpret the images and their meaning in
the study of Mars.</p>

The groups of students were able to participate in the newest discoveries and stand at the forefront of space exploration, something previously unknown to them. In addition, students were introduced to many STEM-related careers and the opportunities available to those who show passion for the field.</p>

<p>Whatâ€™s so amazing about Ad Astra Academy is that the program is able to successfully change studentsâ€™ futures through short interventional steps. It doesnâ€™t take endless time and energy to forever change someoneâ€™s path in life and make a difference, and you donâ€™t need to attend a prestigious university or take on a rigorous class schedule to find a passion in STEM.</p>

<p>There is so much untapped potential in the world that we never get to witness because of the environment people may live in, and the Ad Astra Academy provides a way to reach those children and bring their minds and skills to light.</p>
