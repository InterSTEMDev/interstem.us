<p>You might not think about it often, but the original carbon capturers were trees and plants. For millennia, the world was kept in balance by the emittance of carbon dioxide by humans and the absorption of it by plants. Only during the Industrial Revolution did we stray from this model. Burning coal, natural gas and petroleum put unprecedented levels of toxins and greenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide, into the air. For a long time, people did not understand the huge impact emissions would have on the world. Even after they did, it was ignored for decades and some still ignore it. Even if we reach net-zero Earth, there will still a long period of time before plants can absorb all of this carbon dioxide.</p>
