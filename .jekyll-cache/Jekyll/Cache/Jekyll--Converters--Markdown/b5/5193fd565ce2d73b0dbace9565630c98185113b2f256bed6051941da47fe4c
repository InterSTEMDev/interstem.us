If you are an American, you likely have heard the name ‚ÄúBigfoot‚Äù here and there in addition  to the names ‚ÄúYeti‚Äù and ‚ÄúLoch-ness Monster.‚Äù All three of these names correspond to ‚Äúcryptids,‚Äù  which are monsters that apparently roam our world. According to National Geographic, science has had a long battle with the existence of these monsters, due to the circumstantial evidence documenting their existence. Such evidence, which includes blurry pictures, strange footprints and eyewitness reports, is not enough for scientists to confirm their existence. While both factions are at war with each other, it is safe to say that science is the clear winner. Even so, the lore behind these cryptids and how they tie into the human psyche is interesting.</p>

<p>Some examples of cryptids were listed above, but it is important to know exactly what they are. Donald R. Prothero, a paleontologist who has written over 250 scientific reports, including a  book discussing cryptids, defined them as ‚Äúany animal that has never been described by science,  usually something very unusual along the lines of a Loch Ness monster or Bigfoot, something that  stretches the limits of what is scientifically plausible.‚Äù Prothero‚Äôs definition helps us understand that these cryptids cannot exist, as they seem to stretch what is scientifically possible within our world.  Daniel Loxton, Prothero‚Äôs partner who helped him write the aforementioned book, added on to his definition, stating ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs based on the word cryptozoology, which means hidden life or animals. It  implies a creature that‚Äôs been recorded through folklore, something that we have reason to suspect  exists.‚Äù</p>

<p>All that being said, how can science help us understand the world of cryptozoology more?  First, for cryptids to exist, there cannot only be one cryptid of that species. Basically, Bigfoot is an offspring of other Bigfoot. The ‚Äúmonster‚Äù did not come into existence out of nowhere. The same goes for the other variety of cryptids. Speaking of which, the second way science can help us understand cryptids more is by their size. Many cryptids, such as giant squids and giant okapi, are abnormally large in size, so how is it possible that they have not been recently sighted at all? How would it be possible for them to avoid the public eye for as long as they have? Technology has been rapidly improving each year, making it so that finding these types of creatures should be no problem as of this point in time. The third and final way science can help us understand cryptids is not actually directly related to science itself, but rather the folklore and myths of old. In these stories, a lot of animals, such as bears, would exhibit human-like characteristics. People who know of these folklore stories and myths, upon seeing a weird looking bear, might not realize it is just a bear and think it is something more mystical as a result of these old stories. This is a solid example of the complexities of the human psyche and is also why it is important to take people‚Äôs eye-witness reports with a  grain of salt. Our senses (especially that of sight) can sometimes fool us into thinking we saw something mysterious when it was but a mere shadow of some normal animal.</p>
