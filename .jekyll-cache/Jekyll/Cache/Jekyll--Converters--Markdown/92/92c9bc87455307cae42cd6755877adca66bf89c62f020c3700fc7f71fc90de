In todayâ€™s world, social media plays an active role in the mental health of an individual. Throughout our lives, humans seek interaction with others since being social can foster positivity in a person. But during this era of technology and growing digital interaction, social media has made its way into everyoneâ€™s daily lives. Social media brings exposure to all users, as a craving for attention is now an active figure in the lives of many. What is regarded as a source of entertainment and a form of efficient communication for humans is also the source of increasing mental illness.</p>

<p>A research article by <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Shabir-Bhat/publication/323018957_Effects_of_Social_Media_on_Mental_Health_A_Review/links/5a7c9e97aca272341aeb7472/Effects-of-Social-Media-on-Mental-Health-A-Review.pdf" target="_blank">the International Journal of Indian Psychology</a> states that similarly to the human body, which seeks nutrition, the human mind seeks to be nurtured by thoughts. As social media life separates a person from others in the real world, it affects their mental health and social interaction. The journal found that the younger generation is more susceptible at an embryonic stage of their life. This indicates that because the youth is more easily swayed and most active on social media, they are at a larger risk of serious mental health effects. By being easily influenced by social media, theyâ€™re exposed to situations of bullying and comparing themselves with others online. Online activity has become an essential part of daily life, and while it does contain its benefits like an increase in communication, it can strongly impact the well-being of its users.</p>

<p>Social media is known to cause an increase in anxiety and depression as stated by the International Journal of Indian Psychology. About 45% of British adults have felt restlessness because of a lack of accessing social media sites. The same was found with adolescents. Adolescents are unable to decipher the difference between a notification they receive and one someone else does, a condition known as phantom vibration syndrome. There is a positive correlation between social media and mental health: the longer you spend on social media the more likely you are at risk of depression.</p>

<p>Another look at the topic at hand is the current global situation of COVID-19. Because of the virus outbreak, people are forced to live in isolated circumstances, which leads to a rise in technological use. <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id%3D10.1371/journal.pone.0231924&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1619248925761000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0-TYccMD_hzv4rzkOYRw4S" target="_blank">Plos One</a> brings an insight into mental health problems and their association with social media exposure during COVID-19. By conducting their experiment and surveying the results, it is shown that because of  COVID-19, a rise in misinformation through social media has been an underlying effect of increasing mental illness.</p>

<p>In their investigation, they examined 4,872 Chinese citizens under 18 through online surveys. It was found that about 48% were depressed, 22% had anxiety and 19% had a combination of the two. Shown from the data, itâ€™s believed social media exposure was associated with high anxiety within individuals, and the increase of social media exposure, in general, was due to the COVID outbreak. From this extended use of social media, it was concluded that misinformation that was fueled by social media was an indirect cause of anxiety.</p>

<p>The study had the participants report any experience of positivity in the last two weeks and those that scored less than 13 on their 6-point scale represented depression. Similarly, their study over anxiety had initially the same rating scale where they reported signs of anxiousness during the last two weeks. Those with scores greater than one were assumed to have an anxiety disorder. They determined social media uses by how often the respondents had seen news or information regarding COVID-19 on social media. In the results, the increase of social media exposure corresponded to increased odds of depression as was with anxiety and the combination.</p>

<p>To conclude, the two main reasons to describe the association of social media exposure and mental health is the misinformation in social media, not only the COVID outbreak but in this generation overall. This is likely because of the lack of privacy and expectancy of attention of users that the increase of self unimportance or anxiousness. As a way to prevent such problems and help those who have felt as such, both research articles and studies encourage seeking professional counseling and user age restrictions. In hopes of enlightening others on the harms that social media may cause to oneâ€™s health and for your benefit and growth, monitor and limit your time around the screen.</p>
