<p>Some computer systems are even capable of developing abstract forms of creativity similar to individual thought in the form of meaningful literature and paintings. An example of computer-minded artwork is ‚ÄúEdmond de Belamy‚Äù, a fully AI-generated ‚Äúpainting.‚Äù Through deep learning, AI is able to imitate a creative mind based on previous human work, as seen in the paint strokes and the prominent human figure wearing a suit and collared shirt.  Apart from the visual aspect of art, AI is well capable of creating forms of analytical literature. An open-source artificial intelligence, GPT-2, has created multiple excerpts of poetry and fictional writing.</p>

<p>Here is an example-
And, ere the cloud of the tempest blew,
His soul was with the world at play.
He looked to the stars, and the stars smiled,
And the moon in the heaven looked;
And, as he looked, he beheld her light,
And all the heaven smiled with him.
When winds and tempests fly,
When floods and fires fail,
As their wake doth meadow and fen,
Tis the man-child‚Äôs heart that craves.
And I ‚Äî I shall be bound,
With the hoary-headed, strong, old,
To earth, and the graves of the dead,
Whose feet are mowed down, as they lie;
And I shall rest my weary head,
In the silence of Eternity,
In the peaceful arms of God.</p>

<p>Outstandingly, GPT-2 not only generated a meaningful poem with the possibility of thoughtful creative analysis, but it has also expressed human emotion, religion and curiosity.
The moral argument against AI
AI has constantly proven itself to imitate and exceed human behavior, but this raises concerns within the public opinion: Will AI take away jobs? What will happen to targeted workers? Can AI take over the world?
In reality, these are valid arguments. As this technology advances further in complexity, it can very well branch out and perform tasks related to other fields of work. This seems highly plausible in the coming years as AI has been appealing to most companies since machine learning and neural networking is proven to be much more accurate and sustainable than manual labor. Some are already adopting this fully automated system.
The Yangshan Deep-Water Port is the biggest fully automated container port in Shanghai. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all controlled by artificial intelligence,‚Äù Yang Jiemin, who is in charge of technological support, said to CGTN, as he describes the 24/7 fully automated workforce. If this trend of adopting AI-powered machines grows, by 2030, over 20 million jobs could be replaced by machine learning robots. The fact of the matter is, the complexity and sheer capabilities of machine learning could result in public opinion that sides against the growth of artificial intelligence. The reason being? Robots can replace manual workers.
Apart from the possibility of AI taking over the workforce, many believe it is on its path to take over the world. Although it may seem that AI could develop into an evil army of robotic human beings, most probably due to sci-fi films, AI computing is unable to understand the world through a moral aspect. Partaking in a war against humanity is far beyond machine learning‚Äôs algorithmic capabilities. And while it may seem as if AI has this abstract understanding through its literary and visual art forms, it is unable to fully comprehend what exactly it is generating. After all, a computer system, even as advanced as complex deep learning systems, is unconscious. Algorithms dictate AI capabilities, and a basic understanding of morality is a concept that cannot be written out in an algorithmic form. Translating emotion into binary values for the computer to understand does not seem plausible to achieve anytime soon.
Should AI continue to develop?</p>
