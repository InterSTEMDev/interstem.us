If you are an American, you likely have heard the name â€œBigfootâ€ here and there in addition  to the names â€œYetiâ€ and â€œLoch-ness Monster.â€ All three of these names correspond to â€œcryptids,â€  which are monsters that apparently roam our world. According to National Geographic, science has had a long battle with the existence of these monsters, due to the circumstantial evidence documenting their existence. Such evidence, which includes blurry pictures, strange footprints and eyewitness reports, is not enough for scientists to confirm their existence. While both factions are at war with each other, it is safe to say that science is the clear winner. Even so, the lore behind these cryptids and how they tie into the human psyche is interesting.</p>

<p>Some examples of cryptids were listed above, but it is important to know exactly what they are. Donald R. Prothero, a paleontologist who has written over 250 scientific reports, including a  book discussing cryptids, defined them as â€œany animal that has never been described by science,  usually something very unusual along the lines of a Loch Ness monster or Bigfoot, something that  stretches the limits of what is scientifically plausible.â€ Protheroâ€™s definition helps us understand that these cryptids cannot exist, as they seem to stretch what is scientifically possible within our world.  Daniel Loxton, Protheroâ€™s partner who helped him write the aforementioned book, added on to his definition, stating â€œItâ€™s based on the word cryptozoology, which means hidden life or animals. It  implies a creature thatâ€™s been recorded through folklore, something that we have reason to suspect  exists.â€</p>
