Researcher Emmanuelle Charpentier and biochemist Jennifer Doudna were initially studying the immune system of a Streptococcus bacterium in hopes of developing a new antibiotic, according to <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2020/popular-information/#:~:text=Emmanuelle%20Charpentier%20and%20Jennifer%20Doudna,microorganisms%20with%20extremely%20high%20precision." target="_blank">The Nobel Prize</a>. But akin to other remarkable discoveries, this one didn’t exactly go as planned. Instead, the pair discovered a molecular tool called CRISPR which can be used to make defined cuts in genetic material, presenting an endless array of possibilities for the future of gene-editing.</p>

<p>Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats, also known as CRISPR, are DNA sequences that are naturally found in bacteria. These repeats are actually a collection of mug shots captured by CRISPR associated proteins (Cas). The mug shots are DNA pieces that Cas cut from invaders that attack the bacteria. The snipped DNA fragment is then stored between the palindromic CRISPR sequences to maintain a genetic memory for halting future infections from the same invader.</p>

<p>Until recently, “CRISPR-Cas9” —often called CRISPR for short— has only been known as genetic information that some bacteria use as part of their defense mechanism against viruses. Now, as a gene-editing tool, CRISPR-Cas9 has reformed biomedical research and may soon enable medical breakthroughs in a way few biological innovations have before.
