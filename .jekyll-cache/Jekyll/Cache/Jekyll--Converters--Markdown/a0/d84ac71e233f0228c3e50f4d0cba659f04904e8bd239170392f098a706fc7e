Apple‚Äôs iPhones are currently competing with mobile phones from other countries, such as Huawei from China and Samsung from South Korea.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeQnQ-vjtuY" target="_blank">(YouTube)</a>

Apple is the top mobile phone brand in the United States, with approximately 65% of the national market share. However, this statistic is not necessarily representative of the global market, as records from 2020 show that Apple ranked third in the global smartphone market with 13% of the market share. Samsung, placing second, claimed 19%, while the leading company, Huawei, held 20%. These rankings still stand in 2021, and as Apple, Huawei and Samsung continue to compete for consumers, the spotlight falls on a product that they all have in common: the smartphone.</p>

<p>Arguably the most iconic smartphone brand in the world, Apple released its newest iPhone, the iPhone 12 Pro Max, on Nov. 13, 2020. The iPhone 12 Pro is powered by Apple‚Äôs newest chip, the A14 Bionic, which is the first 5-nanometer chip in the microchip industry featuring a grand total of 11.8 billion transistors. The camera sensors (named the Pro camera system) are also 47% larger than the ones of the previous iPhone. In addition to its larger size, the featured cameras include a new 65 mm telephoto lens and 5X optical zoom range that uses Deep Fusion and Neural Engine to analyze multiple exposures pixel by pixel to bring out unprecedented detail in the photos it takes. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are also used - machine learning helps separate the subject from the background in photos.</p>

<p>The 12 Pro utilizes a LiDAR Scanner that is basically portable Augmented Reality. The LiDAR Scanner is able to measure how long it takes light to reflect back from objects, creating a depth map of any space the user is in and transforming a room into any realistic scene of the user‚Äôs choice in a matter of seconds. These features, and more, are displayed across 3.4 million pixels, the most ever in an iPhone. To complete Apple‚Äôs signature bold and simple look, the iPhone 12 Pro comes in four crisp colors: Pacific Blue, Gold, Silver and Graphite.
China has been rapidly reinventing its global image over the last decade, doubling its number of software companies with a recent count of over 37,800 active Chinese software companies as of year-end 2018, with at least a dozen of these companies reaching valuations of greater than $1 billion. One of these companies, Huawei, is best known for its rapid progress in mobile development and 5G networks, putting it in first place in the global phone manufacturing market as of Q2 2020. Huawei‚Äôs newest mobile phone, the HUAWEI Mate X2, was released on Feb. 25, 2021, and features the signature Huawei ability to seamlessly fold in half, offering users the option of using it as a ‚Äúfolded, 6.45-inch flagship smartphone, or unfolded as an 8-inch FullView Display.‚Äù To better enable this folding option, the Mate X2 utilizes a new and improved multi-dimensional hinge that is made using innovative materials and forging techniques, making the hinge discreetly concealed and giving the Mate X2 a virtually invisible seam.</p>
