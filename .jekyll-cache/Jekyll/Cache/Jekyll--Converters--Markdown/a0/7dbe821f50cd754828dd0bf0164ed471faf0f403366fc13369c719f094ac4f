<p>Beginning at the end of 2019, COVID-19 has claimed the lives of millions of individuals. Currently, after more than six months after the first case was reported, scientists are in the process of creating and testing COVID-19 vaccines.</p>

<p>Although creating an effective vaccine was the moment many have been waiting for, perhaps people should take a moment to look back in history and reflect upon the course of action the U.S. decided to follow during the swine flu outbreak in 1976.</p>

<p>On Feb. 3, 1976, virus isolates from recruits at Fort Dix, New Jersey, who exhibited influenza-like illnesses were sent to the CDC, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Although most of the isolates were identified as the contemporary epidemic strain, CDC found evidence of swine influenza A related to the 1918 flu pandemic, an infection more commonly known as swine flu that killed 50 to 100 million people worldwide.</p>

<p>It was decided a couple of days later, that surveillance at Fort Dix would be heightened, ill recruits would be investigated to determine if contact with pigs had occurred, and recruits would be tested to determine if the swine flu spread.</p>

<p>There was no evidence that recruits had contact with pigs (which was the case during two other instances in the past), but serologic testing revealed that over 200 recruits had been infected and that person-to-person transmission had occurred.</p>

<p>On March 10, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the United States Public Health Service (ACIP) concluded a pandemic was a possibility. The ACIP recommended that an immunization program be launched, as they saw this early detection of the outbreak as an opportunity to produce a vaccine.</p>

<p>“If we believe in prevention, we have no alternative but to offer and urge the immunization of the population,” an ACIP member said.</p>

<p>The CDC director recommended that the federal government should contract with pharmaceutical companies to produce vaccines for the entire population. And news soon reached President Gerald Ford, who then began the National Influenza Immunization Program (NIIP), which had an estimated budget cost of $137 million. An appropriation bill was then passed with unanimous approval from all four committees.</p>

<p>However, not everyone approved of this plan, including a representative from New Jersey and a medical society from Wisconsin.</p>

<p>Furthermore, according to the Department of Epidemiology of UCLA, the insurance industry announced they would not insure the manufacturers against liability from the vaccine. And the pharmaceutical companies also refused to sell the vaccine to the government, which led to Congress passing a bill that guaranteed profits and waived corporate responsibility for the vaccines.</p>

<p>In spite of obstacles presented with developing a vaccine, the NIIP administered a program that immunized 45 million people in 10 weeks.</p>
