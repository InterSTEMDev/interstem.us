Launched in 2009 from the anonymous Satoshi Nakamoto‚Äôs whitepaper, Bitcoin (BTC) was created to be an electronic payment system ‚Äúbased on cryptographic proof instead of trust.‚Äù Bitcoin is now the world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency (digital currency) with an astonishing value of over $55,000 for a single coin and is also the first application of blockchain technology, an innovative creation that allows it to be distributed, traded and stored. A blockchain is essentially a collection of ‚Äúblocks,‚Äù files that record all of the transactions that occur, making them transparent and visible to all of the computers that run Bitcoin‚Äôs code and store its blockchain. The creation of Bitcoin has united thousands of people around the world over a common goal: obtaining bitcoin and turning a profit.</p>

<p>There are currently 12,000 computers connected to Bitcoin‚Äôs blockchain; these computers are called nodes, while the owners of the computers are called miners - the miners control Bitcoin‚Äôs release into circulation via a process called Bitcoin mining and are rewarded with coins adding blocks to the blockchain. Bitcoin mining requires the solving of complex computational puzzles in order to discover a new block, and expensive mining rigs (elaborate mining processors and hardware) increase a miner‚Äôs ability to earn more rewards. Mining rigs are available for purchase in the form of computer chips like Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC) and Graphic Processing Units (GPUs). All of these Bitcoin transactions are verified by cryptographic proof, making the system very secure. For example, a person with malicious intent would need to operate 51% of the total computing power that makes up Bitcoin to cheat the system. With miners acting as Bitcoin‚Äôs decentralized authority, miners are motivated to add to the growing blockchain because of the prospect of reward, and the blockchain benefits by growing and developing even more.</p>
