<p>You might not think about it often, but the original carbon capturers were trees and plants. For millennia, the world was kept in balance by the emittance of carbon dioxide by humans and the absorption of it by plants. Only during the Industrial Revolution did we stray from this model. Burning coal, natural gas and petroleum put unprecedented levels of toxins and greenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide, into the air. For a long time, people did not understand the huge impact emissions would have on the world. Even after they did, it was ignored for decades and some still ignore it. Even if we reach net-zero Earth, there will still a long period of time before plants can absorb all of this carbon dioxide.</p>

<p>Here comes the idea for carbon recapture technology. If we are able to “grab” the carbon dioxide from the air and redeposit it into the ground where it was stored for years in the form of fossil fuels, then we will be able to save the Earth from the climate crisis. Unfortunately, it is not that simple. The technology has been around since the 1970s, but it has not really taken off. These days we hear about solar, hydro, wind and other forms of clean energy, but carbon recapture is often not in the conversation. However, to be fair, Elon Musk recently tweeted about giving 100 million dollars to carbon recapture technology.</p>

<p>Still, the financial problem of carbon recapture technology persists. The financial incentive for a company to fund an expensive process to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and place it back into the ground does not exist. Why fund a company that removes carbon from the air in an expensive way rather than one that releases it with no immediate consequence? Maybe with more regulation and costs associated with releasing carbon dioxide, the financial incentive to support carbon recapture technology will grow.</p>

<p>In the meantime though, carbon recapture technology continues to get better. For example, Berend Smit on CNBC says he is trying a new technology that involves carbon dioxide flowing through a sponge with chemicals that latch onto the carbon dioxide in the air and when it is heated Carbon Dioxide can be separated from the sponge and sent to storage underground. With this technology, carbon recapture will be able to be more freestanding and mobile, so it will require less machinery. According to Paitoon Tontiwachwuthikul, this new innovation could cost up to 70%.</p>
