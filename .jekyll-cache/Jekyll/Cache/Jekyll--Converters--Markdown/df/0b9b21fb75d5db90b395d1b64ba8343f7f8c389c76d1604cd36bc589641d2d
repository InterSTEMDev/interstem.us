If you are like me, we belong to the 90 percent of the world’s population of right-handed people. This is in fact genetically determined although it isn’t clear why our evolution has led to more righties than lefties. It is a major belief that lefties and righties are right and left brained respectively. According to a new research, the idea of people being either left or right brained may not be as fixed as we thought.</p>

<p>It is a widely acknowledged fact that most animals have an anatomically and functionally asymmetric brain. While some of the differences are learned others are inherited.</p>

<p>It may be a random assignment of which side of the brain is dominant but a spectrum of possibilities that are available indicates that there might be something more than just randomness working.</p>

<p>Studies conducted on zebrafish embryos about their developing brain suggest that there might be a fight of dominance between the hemispheres. Researchers have known that neurons migrate long distances in a developing brain. It is controlled by a gene called fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8). It creates a protein and the protein acts as a magnet to attract nerve cells to one hemisphere of the brain.</p>

<p>The absolute differences in the number of cells are very less but what differ are the types of neurons on left and right and in their connections. Both sides of the brain contain FGF8, leading to a tug-of-war to attract certain migrating nerve cells. But this is an unfair fight. FGF8 in the left-brain as an ally, another protein, called Nodal, is present only on the left side of the brain. When it teams up with FGF8, the pair wins, causing a predictable pattern of neuron connections in the left hemisphere that helps to explain why there is consistent handedness between individuals.</p>
