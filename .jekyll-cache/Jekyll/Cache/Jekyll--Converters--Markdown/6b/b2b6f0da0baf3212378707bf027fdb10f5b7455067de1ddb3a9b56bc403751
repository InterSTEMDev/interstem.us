You probably took a chemistry course at some point in your life â€” maybe it was a six-week introductory unit in eighth grade science, or maybe it was a year-long high school class. It is entirely possible that you have not thought about chemistry since you took that course many years ago, but chemistry applies to your life every day in the simplest way â€” through cooking. When you cook a meal, you witness chemistry in action.</p>

<p>A recipe starts with ingredients that all have nutritional benefits. But after you cook these raw ingredients, how do these nutritional benefits change? Does a cooked carrot have the same health benefits as a raw carrot? To understand how cooking affects nutrition levels in food, letâ€™s look at the beginning of a recipe for vegetable hand-pies and walk through a couple of examples of nutritional changes.</p>

<p>This recipe calls for four different vegetables (clockwise from upper-left) â€” carrots, potatoes, rutabagas (potato-like root vegetable), and onions.</p>

<p>Before they can be added to the hand-pies as filling, all of these vegetables need to be precooked. The carrots, potatoes, and rutabagas will be cooked by steam â€” three minutes in the microwave will serve them well.</p>

<p>Cooked carrots are a popular topic amongst the food bloggers of the internet â€” some people argue that cooking carrots destroys the nutrients in them, while others argue that cooked carrots are more nutritious than uncooked carrots. According to Scientific American, it turns out both arguments are correct â€” cooking carrots lowers their Vitamin C levels, but it also elevates their Vitamin A and antioxidant levels.</p>

<p>Cooking potatoes makes them more digestible by changing the types of starches in them from indigestible starches to digestible starches. These changes allow our bodies to obtain energy from the potato.</p>

<p>SFGate reports that the nutrition content of rutabagas changes minimally when the large root vegetable is cooked. Just like carrots, cooked rutabaga has less Vitamin C than raw rutabaga; root vegetables tend to lose Vitamin C when cooked. However, the beneficial fiber, iron, zinc, and vitamin A levels all stay intact through the cooking process.</p>
