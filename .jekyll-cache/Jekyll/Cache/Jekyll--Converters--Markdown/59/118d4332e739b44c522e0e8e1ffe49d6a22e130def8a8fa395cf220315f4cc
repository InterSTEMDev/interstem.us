For as long as humans have studied astronomy, Mars has been defined by its reddish-orange hue. However, recent scientific discovery has noted that Mars closely resembled Earth billions of years ago, with lakes, rivers, seas, oceans and perhaps even life. And due to gradual processes that are taking place right now, Earth will closely resemble Mars in the distant future.</p>

<p>The hue on Mars is a product of natural chemical processes. Mars is a terrestrial planet, composed of silicate rocks and metals. All metals are susceptible to a chemical process known as corrosion, which happens through oxidation. In chemistry, oxidation is the loss of electrons during a chemical reaction, and reduction is the complementary gain of electrons. When metals are oxidized, they corrode and become a reddish-orange hue. For example, iron is oxidized by water and oxygen, creating rust:</p>

<p>4Fe + 3O2 + 6H2O â†’ 4Fe(OH)3</p>

<p>All metals are electropositive and are disposed to losing electrons in a chemical reaction. Therefore, corrosion puts metals in their most natural and chemically stable state, and all metalsâ€”including stainless steel or silverâ€”are susceptible to a type of corrosion at some point. This also means that terrestrial planets, composed of metal, are susceptible to corrosion.</p>

<p>On a much larger scale, atmospheric escape plays a major role in Marsâ€™ hue. Atmospheric escape is a natural planetary process in which atmospheric gases are lost to outer space. The driving factor of atmospheric escape is heat; as gases are heated, they expand. Atmospheres are bound only by gravity, and at 5,778 K (9,941Â°F), the Sun provides more than enough heat to lift an atmosphere away from its planet. Through deep analysis of the Martian surface, planetary scientists have come to a consensus that Mars used to be full of water, which explains how it dried out and corroded. At high enough temperatures, water can break down into hydrogen and oxygen. Hydrogen has the lowest atomic weight of all elements and can therefore easily escape into the atmosphere and then into space. Oxygen, almost 16 times heavier, expands into space at a much slower rate. Therefore, while hydrogen was escaping from Mars, oxygen remained on the surface for a bit and oxidized the surface of Mars. The data correspondâ€”the Martian crust, corroded from oxidization, is composed of iron, magnesium, aluminum, calcium and potassium, along with oxygen and silicon.</p>
