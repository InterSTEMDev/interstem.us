<center><i>Languages can all be connected to one another utilizing a “tree” as a visual representation. From here, we can see how the Romance languages, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, French, and Catalan, as well as other minor ones, stem from the same branch.

There’s no doubt that in today’s fast paced, multicultural, connected world, it’s beneficial to know more than one language. Over half the world– estimated to be between 60 and 75%– speak at least two languages, according to Gaia Vince from BBC’s Future. In fact, our brains have evolved to understand multiple languages, to look for clues and to decipher foreign words we have seldom encountered. Language is a complex combination of sounds and symbols that all come together to represent a group of people connected by culture, and, if one follows the signs, they can unlock a world of understanding.</p>

<p>Latin is a unique language to learn because it is no longer spoken, only written and read. We can trace thousands of our words back to their Latin roots and witness the long-lasting presence of the Romans in our governmental structure, art and literature.</p>

<p>This brings me to today, where I sat down with Latin teacher Dr. Jeffrey Feland, a faculty member of Sage Hill School in Newport, CA. He works with students in Latin classes one through four, runs the Junior Classical League, a club that participates in annual challenges and competitions and is a favorite amongst the students. A common theme that emerged from our interview was how important patterns are to a language, and he explained how seeing them helped him excel in his learning.</p>

<p><b>Reagan Smith</b>: So starting off, how many languages do you know, and what are they?</p>

<p><b>Jeffrey Feland</b>: Well, I would say I know Latin and Ancient Greek, but I’ve never had to speak to others in them. Then, I can understand, read and speak Spanish and know basic conversational Italian, French and German. I feel fairly fluent in modern Greek– but then of course that brings up the question of how to define “fluency.”</p>
