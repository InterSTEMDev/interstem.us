Covering 70% of the Earthâ€™s surface and containing 50 to 80% of life as we know it, the ocean is our most valuable resource, but it is in danger. Although the Science History Institute reports observations of plastic pollution as early as the 1960s, the threat of irreversible damage due to pollution has become increasingly obvious in the past decade.</p>

<p>Every year, over eight million tons of plastics enter the ocean and wreak havoc on marine life. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), plastics of all sizes can be deadly. Large, floating tangles of netting and trash can trap sea creatures or provide transportation for invasive species across the ocean. Smaller pieces can wrap around animals or be confused for food. Over time, plastics may seem to break down, but in reality, they only break apart into tiny pieces. These microplastics absorb harmful chemicals and are often mistaken for plankton by predators and make their way up the food chain.</p>

<p>Eventually, the ocean plastics accumulate in one of the worldâ€™s five massive rotating current systems called gyres. Once theyâ€™ve reached the gyres, the plastics form patches of concentrated debris. The most famous is the Great Pacific Garbage Patch which covers nearly 1.6 million square kilometers, or three times the size of France.</p>

<p>So, how can we remove these mini-continent-sized garbage patches? This question is being asked by scientists everywhere and is especially important to young people, who believe if a solution is not found soon, the damages will haunt them for the rest of their lives and generations to come.</p>
