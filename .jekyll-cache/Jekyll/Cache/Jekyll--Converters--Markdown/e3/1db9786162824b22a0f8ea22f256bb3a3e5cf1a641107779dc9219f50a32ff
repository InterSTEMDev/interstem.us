Many people are shy when it comes to social situations. They might feel hesitant to meet new people and feel overwhelmed by social gatherings such as parties. These feelings are completely normal, but they can reach a point of severity where they are not. Some people feel terrified of the mere idea of meeting new people, and they might completely avoid social gatherings as a result. These people likely have what is known as social anxiety disorder (SAD), which they can either be born with or develop over time.</p>

<p>Sometimes referred to as social phobia, SAD causes a plethora of irrational feelings for whoever suffers from it. People with the disorder realize a lot of their feelings are hyperbolic, but sometimes, they may feel powerless to do anything about how it influences their cognition towards the world. Although it was compared to shyness previously, SAD is far more damaging. It can seriously deteriorate someoneâ€™s relationship with themself, their family, friends, work and school.</p>

<p>With SAD impacting 7% of Americans (15 million of the overall population), a large number of peopleâ€™s lives are negatively impacted due to the disorder. The high percentage indicates this is one of the most common mental disorders in America. With such prevalence, it is important to know some of the symptoms of SAD. This can help you assist someone who may have it, or even yourself. Some symptoms include trembling or shaking, rapid heart rate and dizziness. Those are just physical symptomsâ€” some psychological ones include worrying deeply about social situations, concerning yourself with upcoming social activities days or weeks before they even occur and potentially using drugs to calm down any fear related to social contexts. These symptoms only become worse with the assumptions that the disorder gives you: that everyone notices everything you do and silently judges you at every chance they get. This can cause an unrelenting feeling of exhaustion for the person with SAD, so getting the proper support is in that personâ€™s best interest.</p>
