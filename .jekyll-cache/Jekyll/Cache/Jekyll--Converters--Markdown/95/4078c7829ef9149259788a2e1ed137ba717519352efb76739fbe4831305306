<p>A common, loose-ended icebreaker question: What is your greatest fear in life? Some might mention earthquakes, spiders or heights. But for me, I’d say death. However, with a recent discovery on reverse human aging, scientists are getting even closer to elongating the lives of humans and making that ultimate fearless prominent.</p>

<p>In Ancient Egypt, the average lifetime was about 19 years due to the immense risks that children faced. Even for those who survived childhood, life expectancies, at most, were 30 years for women and 34 years for men. Fast-forward to 1920, and the life expectancy reached 53.6 years for men and 54.6 years for women. Yet, in just a century, it has soared to an average of 78.9 years in the United States. This increase in life expectancy in the past has been attributed to substantial scientific understanding in which public health measures have been adopted by the vast majority of populations.</p>

<p>Generally, as the human body ages, the protective tips of chromosomes known as telomeres begin shrinking, and along with it, the body produces an increase of malfunctioning senescent cells. Senescent cells are, in short, vital in their role of tumor suppression and wound healing. Thus, an expanded malfunctioning of senescent cells can contribute to age-related diseases. In order to increase life expectancy beyond its limits and essentially rewind the process of human aging, researchers and scientists have been targeting these two integral components of the aging process.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/11/201120150728.htm" target="_blank">A clinical trial</a>, involving 34 adults over the ages of 65, put a method known as hyperbaric oxygen therapy to the test, to determine if aging could in fact be reversed. The trial placed subjects in a pressurized chamber where they were supplied with pure oxygen for 90 minutes a day, five days a week over the course of three months. Data concludes that telomeres increased by about 20% average in length, and that useless cells were reduced by up to 37%.</p>

<p>“Today telomere shortening is considered the ‘Holy Grail’ of the biology of aging,” Professor Efrati of Tel Aviv University, who led the clinical trial, said. “Our HBOT protocol was able to achieve this, proving that the aging process can in fact be reversed at the basic cellular-molecular level.”</p>

<p>In other words, this trial and its results are providing a path forward for the future of research and are emulating how scientists can continue delving into unknown realms of science. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) can also be used for various other applications, such as treating carbon monoxide poisoning and infections or wounds where tissue is depleted or starved for oxygen.</p>

<p>There have been other attempts recently, some of which have been proven successful; others unsuccessful. In 2015, an unverified biotech company claimed that permanent changes could be made to one’s DNA that could combat muscle loss and other age-related conditions. In fact, attempts to alter life expectancy go as far back as hunter-gatherers, or approximately 30,000 years ago, with efforts to keep a tribe healthy and stable enough to survive in the long term. These days, there are significantly more technologically advanced ways we must look to increase life expectancy, such as what this trial has investigated. However, there are also numerous non-technological methods that we as a species can adapt further to increase life expectancy. Consuming a more plant-based diet, limiting exposure to cigarettes and second-hand smoking and simply getting health screenings and exams on a regular basis can all add years to the average life expectancy.</p>

<p>As technologically interconnected and advanced, wealthy nations continue to pave the way in new technological methods, we should simultaneously exponentially increase our efforts in third world countries. Not only should we expand technological research in third world societies, such as has already been done in countries like Rwanda and Kazakhstan, but we should improve access to health screenings in these countries. Thousands of organizations, companies and initiatives have already jumpstarted the future of healthcare in these countries, but every citizen can further contribute to humanity’s attempts to increase life expectancy.</p>

<p>Of course, none of these studies, such as the one conducted by Tel Aviv University, can fully verify the impacts of this treatment due to the small sample size. However, time will tell, literally, how this trial will age and how humans in the future may adopt both sci-fi-like reverse aging and simple yet effective public health measures in the near future.</p>
