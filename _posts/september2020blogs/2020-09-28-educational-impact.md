In early March, schools were presented with the tough task of completing their academic terms without face-to-face learning, as 50 million students were left with a compromised form of education. Online school renders a less-rigorous schedule for most students, which is concerning for many parents who strive for their kids to be academically challenged in the classroom. With schools opening up in the late summer, school districts are scrambling to figure out what type of learning would offer both safe and quality education for these students--- all with different standards and wants. Unfortunately, with many districts making adverse choices to one another, disagreement has struck between not only them but also with the parents’ and students’ opinions regarding this issue.

One side of the argument consists of individuals who believe in the importance of face-to-face learning and would choose to send themselves or their children back to school despite COVID-19. They express concern regarding the anxiety, depression and overall regression of students who need school to gauge success in academia.

President Donald Trump has supported the reopening of schools since summer break ended. He argues that scientific evidence pledges that the transition back into the classroom will be beneficial, as the immunity of children from COVID-19 should be done before adult immunity. However, immunity to the virus for an individual is indicative of whether they have previously contracted it or not. Therefore, the idea of infecting students and putting them at risk of contracting side effects potentially worse than expected does not sit well with some. Gokul Prasad, freshman at UCSD, contends how “school boards are far too optimistic of how quickly they can reopen. Despite varying levels of COVID-19 presence around the nation, it is still far too high to think about reopening.” Although Prasad has graduated from high school, he worries that his younger siblings may get sent back to school too early, and may be at risk to contract the potentially deadly virus.

Those who believe that schools should not reopen in the fall are faced with another debate: the quality of online academia. Prasad believes that online learning in the previous school year was insufficient, as the “sudden transition from in-person to online classes was the main root of issues.” He believes that with the summer to plan out class schedules via an online platform, students should be better prepared to handle an online atmosphere.

Whether separate school districts choose to go completely online, completely in person, or both is a decision which will not be fully agreed on among the guardians’ of the attendees; however, as Olsen depicts, “the quality of education will be the most crucial factor for however the schools choose to operate.”
