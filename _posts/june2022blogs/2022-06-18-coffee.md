Coffee is a miracle beverage enjoyed by millions of people worldwide on a daily basis. However, the caffeine in coffee that makes a person more alert does more than just that, and that cup of coffee overall does justice to the drinker. Coffee, along with the taste and energy, comes with many benefits!



<br><span style="font-weight: 900">What is coffee?</span>

Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from certain flowering plants in the Coffea genus. From the coffee fruit, the seeds are separated to produce a stable, raw product: unroasted green coffee. The seeds are then roasted, a process which transforms them into a consumable product, roasted coffee, which is ground into fine particles typically steeped in hot water before being filtered out. This is what produces a cup of coffee. 

Coffee is darkly colored, bitter, slightly acidic and has a stimulating effect in humans, primarily due to its caffeine content. It is one of the most popular drinks in the world and can be prepared and presented in a variety of ways (such as espresso French press, caffè latte, or already-brewed canned coffee). It is usually served hot, although chilled or iced coffee is also common. 


<br><span style="font-weight: 900">What benefits does drinking coffee have?</span>

To name a few, coffee boosts your energy level. Coffee contains caffeine, a central nervous system stimulant that is known for its ability to fight fatigue and increase energy levels. This is because caffeine blocks the receptors of a neurotransmitter called adenosine, which increases levels of other neurotransmitters that regulate energy levels, one being dopamine. In addition, coffee is often used as an ergogenic aid by athletes looking to improve performance and increase energy levels. An ergogenic aid is also called a performance enhancer. One review of nine studies reported that drinking coffee before exercise improved people’s endurance and decreased their perceived exertion when compared with a control group. Additionally, a large review reported that moderate caffeine consumption could slightly improve power output and time-trial completion time. However, results varied, so the researchers also noted that caffeine may affect people differently.

While drinking coffee is enjoyed by many and comes with plenty of pros, there’s some downsides to it. First of all, bad coffee can be toxic. Bad quality coffee could have impurities, which can cause sickness and headaches. Even one ruined bean could ruin your coffee. In addition, coffee can cause insomnia and restlessness. This is due to the caffeine in the coffee. Your recommended maximum amount of caffeine is 400 milligrams, roughly the amount that you’ll get from 4 cups of coffee. If you’re caffeine-sensitive, be careful with coffee. You are probably already aware what amount and what kind of coffee suits, or doesn't suit you. The amount of caffeine that is safe for human consumption is actually written in our DNA.

In conclusion, coffee is loved by millions of people around the world and will likely continue to be for years to come. Drinking coffee can provide plenty of benefits such as keeping us energized and supplying plenty of energy, although there’s some negative aspects of coffee, such as causing insomnia and restlessness. However, everything has its ups and downs and if coffee is what you’re into then go for it!
