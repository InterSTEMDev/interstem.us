Throughout the search for a possible vaccine or cure to the quickly spreading COVID-19, over 100 countries have joined the World Health Organization (WHO) in its international effort to evaluate four of the world‚Äôs top candidates in stamping out the virus.

<span style="font-weight: 900;">What is WHO?</span>  
WHO, also known as the World Health Organization, is a large contributor to the fight against the spread of COVID-19. Announced on <a href="https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---18-march-2020" target="_blank">March 18. 2020</a>, the Solidarity Trials are adapted phase III-IV clinical trials held internationally in hopes of both speeding up the time required to produce effective medicine and requiring fewer COVID-19 patients with severe symptoms to be tested upon.

<span style="font-weight: 900;">Four Candidates for COVID-19 Treatments</span>  
It was recently announced as of June. 17 that the first among the four candidates was being dropped from further examinations and test trials. Originally intended as an antimalarial drug, hydroxychloroquine is a disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) which targets the disease in the body rather than alleviating the symptoms caused by the disease. Generally, DMARDs such as <a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2017/009768s037s045s047lbl.pdf" target="_blank">hydroxychloroquine</a> inhibit B and T cells to suppress overactive immune system responses. However, during periods of tests, it was found to be neither detrimental nor beneficial to hospitalized patients.

The second among the four is an antiviral drug known as remdesivir that was made to target Hepatitis C and eventually used on patients with Ebola. In order to virally replicate, Sars-Cov-2 requires the presence of <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/368/6498/1499" target="_blank">RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase</a> (RdRp). <a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Remdesivir#section=Pharmacology" target="_blank">Remdesivir</a> is a complex incorporated by RdRp that stops the complete synthesis of RNA required for viral replication. Although there are serious side effects implicated as a medication such as organ impairments, countless studies indicate that this could be the most promising treatment and that potential benefits outweigh the risks involved. Already, the drug has been found to shorten infection periods.

A third choice is a combination of the antiretroviral medicines, lopinavir and ritonavir. These medications are both HIV medications, inhibiting HIV proteases which prevents HIV viruses from latching onto and invading healthy cells. However in an <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001282" target="_blank">experiment</a> in which 99 patients were treated with the antiretroviral drugs and standard care and 100 patients were treated with simply standard care, there was not much observable change between the two groups in both the mortality rate and viral RNA detection. This indicates a lack in effectiveness of this particular treatment.

The last option was presented as the inclusion of interferon ùõΩ in addition to the lopinavir‚Äîritonavir combination. The primary role of interferon ùõΩ is to reduce the immune system response by inhibiting interferon ùõæ which is what starts the inflammatory process during infection. In a <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31042-4/fulltext" target="_blank">research study</a> the presence of interferon ùõΩ in comparison to just the lopinavir‚Äîritonavir treatment was found to reduce symptoms and viral shedding, thus reducing the hospitalization duration for patients with mild to moderate cases of Covid-19.

<span style="font-weight: 900;">Conclusion</span>  
It is true that a cure has not been developed yet, and most vaccines take several years minimum to develop. Yet as mankind races against time, developing the Solidarity Trials, which are designed to reduce approximately 80% of the required time for testing a vaccine, there will soon be a solution to the COVID-19 pandemic.
