description: With the start of a new year and the COVID-19 vaccine becoming available, it is important to look back on all that vaccines have done and debunk some of the misconceptions surrounding them. How did inoculation come to be? Who really invented vaccines? How has public opinion changed through the years? An understanding of the history of vaccines brings an appreciation for the science behind them.

As news of the COVID-19 vaccine floods headlines, the spread of myths and misconceptions surrounding vaccines is at an all time high. Many cringe at the thought of introducing foreign substances into their bodies, and wordy lists of molecules used in vaccines circulate the internet to elicit angry responses from the masses. The bases of these fears are simple: we are afraid of what we do not understand.

The science behind vaccines is complicated, and resistance against advancements in medicine is certainly not a new phenomenon. To many, vaccines seem like a magic, ‘too-good-to-be-true’ fix to deadly diseases, and the decision to take them boils down to a question of trust. Perhaps, to combat hesitancy, a quick trip through history will remind us of what vaccines have done and help us understand the necessity of them.

The concept of <a href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/smallpox/sp_variolation.html" target="_blank">inoculation</a>, or creating immunity by introducing the immune system to a disease, is far from new; evidence of a similar procedure has been traced all the way back to ancient China. A method called variolation involved the drying and powdering of smallpox scabs which were then inhaled through the nose. Patients contracted a mild form of smallpox and were left immune once they recovered. By the 18th century, the procedure had spread to India, Africa and the Ottoman Empire.

Variolation came to Europe in the early 1700s when the wife of a British ambassador observed the procedure in Constantinople. Soon after, the royal family was vaccinated against smallpox and variolation became popular among the upper class.

Although resulting in similar effects, vaccination and its predecessor, variolation, are quite different. Variolation had a much higher mortality rate because the patient had to have been able to recover from the infection, and the procedure was often done without proper sterilization. Variolation also used the actual disease rather than a weakened or similar form and is no longer used in modern medicine.

The invention of modern vaccination is often credited to Edward Jenner in 1796, but could more accurately be attributed to <a href="https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/pediatrics/139/4/e20162833.full.pdf" target="_blank">Benjamin Jesty</a>, a farmer from Dorset, England. At the time, milkmaids were known for their smooth skin, which was not covered by the smallpox scars that many adults had, and they were able to care for relatives who were sick with smallpox without contracting the disease themselves. Jesty hypothesized that the immunity had something to do with the cowpox that milkmaids were prone to, a mild disease similar to smallpox that came from touching the udders of affected cows.

In 1774, 22 years before Jenner conducted his famous experiment, Jesty vaccinated his family with cowpox in response to a smallpox outbreak in Dorset. Unfortunately, his wife’s arm became infected at the site of the puncture wound. Although she recovered quickly, the news of Jesty’s experiment had spread through the community like wildfire. He and his family were run out of town by a mob who believed Jesty wanted to turn them all into half-human, half-cow monsters.

In 1805, after Jenner’s findings had been published, Jesty was invited to London by the Original Vaccine Pock Institution where he proved that his vaccine worked by infecting his oldest son, who had been vaccinated 31 years earlier with smallpox. The Institution declared Jesty’s success in September of 1805 in the Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal and rewarded him with a portrait, <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(06)69878-4/fulltext" target="_blank">rediscovered in 2004</a> by the U.K.’s Wellcome Trust.

<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/jenner_edward.shtml" target="_blank">Edward Jenner</a> conducted his famous experiment in 1796 when he came to a similar conclusion as Jesty and tested the idea on his gardener's eight-year-old son. After continued experimentation, Jenner’s findings were published in 1798 but were met with the same backlash Jesty received. Uneasiness at the idea of introducing material from a sick animal into one’s body overwhelmed the potential of his discovery. Newspaper cartoons in 1802 even depicted people with cow heads but as the vaccine was proven effective, ridicule declined.

<a href="https://www.historyofvaccines.org/timeline/all" target="_blank">Vaccines were brought to the U.S.</a> in 1800 by Benjamin Waterhouse with President Thomas Jefferson’s support. As vaccination was proven effective, laws were proposed to require children attending school to be vaccinated against smallpox, inspired by similar laws in Europe and efforts towards eradication of the disease. However, these laws were met with protests. Parents, in particular, were opposed to the procedure as it involved an incision in their child’s arm.

By the 1890s, as cases of smallpox became increasingly rare and vaccines were made more effective and safe, the occasional adverse reactions became much more obvious. Even in the wake of multiple deadly outbreaks, growing opposition to vaccines would resurface amongst government efforts to require them. This trend would continue through the next century, with measles, diphtheria, tuberculosis, polio and others.

Meanwhile, as public opinion rose and fell, advancements in vaccination technology continued. In 1879, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Louis-Pasteur/Vaccine-development" target="_blank">Louis Pasteur</a>, best known for his invention of pasteurization, used live, weakened cultures of chicken cholera to vaccinate chickens against the infection. This was the first use of a weakened microbe as a vaccine. He later extended this principle to anthrax and discovered a vaccine with the help of funding from local farmers.

In 1882, Pasteur once again extended this principle of milder vaccines to rabies. At first, he incorrectly assumed the disease was caused by a microbe rather than a virus and began preserving the spinal cords of infected rabbits to better observe it. Instead, he found that his preservation method had actually neutralized the virus, creating the first neutralizing antibody and paving the way for a new type of vaccine called inactivated vaccines. The first use of Pasteur’s rabies vaccine was on a nine-year-old boy who had been bitten by a dog. His success marked the beginning of preventative medicine.

Through the years, it seems as if there were two sides to the history of vaccines. On one hand, the scientific advancement of vaccines has been clearly, steadily improving. On the other hand, responses to vaccines have been varied, as the fear of deadly diseases and interference wrestle for control over public opinions.

It is important to understand that science does not exist in a vacuum; whether or not the public accepts a scientific advancement is just as important as the advancement itself. The natural reaction to avoid what we do not understand has become more apparent in recent history as science has quickly surpassed the awareness of the average person. Understanding how far vaccines have come and all the good they’ve done is imperative if one wishes to manage the science behind them. It helps to remember that the discoveries of today were not made overnight; they have been built on years of hard work by people attempting to understand the world around them in order to help the people they care for most.
