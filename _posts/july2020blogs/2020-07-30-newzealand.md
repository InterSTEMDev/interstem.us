It has been 191 days since the first confirmed COVID-19 case in the United States. As of July 29th, there have been 151,000 deaths and a total of 4.5 million cases just in America.

On June 8th, New Zealand’s Prime Minister, Jacinda Ardern, announced her country’s next phase into Alert Level 1. Alert Level 1 allows citizens to participate in their activities with no restrictions, as quarantine is lifted. However, their border remains closed and at a close watch. But how was New Zealand’s response to the pandemic different from America’s and what can be learned from a small island country in Oceania?

According to National Geographic, after only six COVID-19 cases on March 15th, New Zealand arguably underwent one of the strictest lockdown policies compared to the rest of the world. They first started at Level 4, where only essential businesses such as hospitals, grocery stores, and gas stations could be open. This was their first response to the pandemic. New Zealand went for an early approach to the virus, minimizing the spread and the number of cases.

One method of response that benefited New Zealand in reducing cases can be seen in their supply of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). When countries such as the United States were in a panic for PPE such as masks and gloves, the New Zealand government identified companies in their country that could help the production of PPE, putting them on a list called the PPE register, according to Radio New Zealand. Not only was there a response from large organizations, but even local businesses helped create supplies for their country. This can be seen as a collective effort by the people to end the transmission of the virus.

However, what was most notable in their fight against this deadly virus was the rate of testing. While the U.S was starting their testing methods for COVID-19, they were looking at a testing kit that was low in supply. New Zealand solved this issue by looking for a less common way of testing from Asia. Because of this effort, New Zealand had a testing rate of about 2,200 tests for every 100,000 people by May, even surpassing the testing rates of both South Korea and the U.S.

In the end, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern showed us what a response to the pandemic should look like, reflecting New Zealand’s innovation as a country. Her efforts proved to be effective in the rate of testing and allowed more citizens to be more cautious if they had contracted the virus. Even in her speeches, she repeatedly referred to her team as a “team of 5 million”, thus uniting the New Zealand people under a common goal: to stop the spread of COVID-19. Individuals should learn that although New Zealand’s response may not work in other countries with larger populations, a quick and early effort is what every country needs.
